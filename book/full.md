# Preface

_Complete Spanish Step-by-Step_ is a progressive program that will help you
learn Spanish—talking, reading, and writing—as quickly and as
thoroughly as possible, and then lead you to mastery and fluency in the
language. Written for beginner and advanced-beginner learners, it teaches
grammar and conversation in the most logical order to enable you to
develop your language skills naturally to the level of intermediate and
advanced learners.

To take full advantage of the unique grammatical progression of the
book, you should study each chapter, or step, one after another. Do not skip
around. Each step you take will lead you to the next. Each chapter contains
clear grammar explanations; be sure to understand every concept before
moving on to the next. Notice that there are few exceptions to rules, so
once you have learned a concept, it is yours.

Try to learn the vocabulary and verbs provided; they have been
carefully selected on the basis of usefulness and frequency. The
vocabulary lists will help enhance your communication, while complete
verb conjugations are given so that you can practice pronunciation as you
learn verbs. Over 300 of the most common verbs in Spanish are presented.

Varied written and oral exercises are included to check your
understanding and progress. (The book has a complete answer key in the
back.) It is also a good idea to write your own questions and sentences and
practice them aloud. Sometimes, your own creations are more interesting
and aid in learning.
Original readings are included in every chapter; they become
progressively more challenging in form and content throughout the book,
leading to poems and stories by acclaimed authors. Use these Reading
Comprehension sections to learn new vocabulary and to practice reading
aloud.


_Complete Spanish Step-by-Step_ is divided into six parts. The first gives
you all the fundamentals of the language in the present tense. You will
notice that the word order of English and Spanish in this part is essentially
the same. This makes learning in the early stages very quick. The second
part explains indirect objects, direct objects, direct object pronouns,
reflexive verbs, and the present subjunctive. The third part presents the
two most used tenses in the past, the preterit and the imperfect. The fourth
part reviews the present tense and uses of _ser_ and _estar_ , the preterit and
imperfect tenses, the progressive tenses, the present subjunctive, and
commands. The fifth part is an in-depth explanation of nouns, articles,
adjectives, pronouns, and the present and past perfect tenses. The sixth
part covers the future and conditional tenses, the past subjunctive, and
idioms.
A student once asked me if Spanish is truly easy. It is, in comparison to
any of the other languages of the world. To start with, the pronunciation is
easy. Spanish is a phonetically perfect language, which means that once
you learn to pronounce each vowel and consonant, you will be able to
pronounce all words correctly. Before you begin, practice all the sounds
outlined in the Guide to Pronunciation in the following pages. If possible,
try to practice with a native speaker. Then, remember to read and answer
questions aloud as much as you can to develop your pronunciation.

This book is written with a logical approach that makes it accessible,
even when some concepts are difficult, whether you are a self-study
learner or a student in an organized teaching program. With _Complete
Spanish Step-by-Step_ , you will see that everything falls quickly into place.
In a few weeks, you will be able to read and write Spanish quite easily, and
as you progress, you will learn to speak fluently, using all elements of
Spanish. And once you learn the Spanish in this book, you will be able to
get along in any Spanish-speaking country. The grammar is standard in all
parts of the Spanish-speaking world, and although accents change from
place to place, you will get accustomed to the sounds very quickly. Have
fun and enjoy using Spanish everywhere you need it. See you in
Xochicalco!

### Guide to Pronunciation

Spanish spelling is an exact reflection of the pronunciation of the
language. The pronunciation of each letter is subject to precise and
consistent rules, and words are pronounced by adding together the sounds
of each individual letter.

### Vowels

The sounds of the vowels are clear and short. Pronounce the examples.


### Consonants

In Spanish, the _b_ and _v_ have the same sound. The sound of English _v_ does
not exist in Spanish.



### Stress, Written Accentuation, and Spelling

#### Natural Stress

Words that end in a vowel ( **a, e, i, o, u** ) or the consonants **n** or **s** have their
natural stress on the next to last syllable.

Words that end in any consonant other than **n** or **s** have their natural stress
on the final syllable.


#### Written Accents

When a word does not follow one of these two rules, it will have a written
accent on the syllable that is stressed.

If a one-syllable word has a written accent, it means that there is another
word in the language that has the same spelling, but another meaning.

If a two-syllable word has a written accent that does not affect the
pronunciation, it means that there is another word that has the same
spelling, but a different meaning.

Interrogative words have an accent mark that does not affect
pronunciation.


#### Spelling Changes

**- z** to **c**

```
Nouns and adjectives that end in z change to c to form the plural.
```
```
Z followed by a or o changes to c before an e or i. The sound of z and c
are the same.
```
- **Other spelling changes**

```
All other spelling changes occur in order to maintain a required sound.
Tocar , for example, has a hard c sound that must be preserved in
other forms of the verb. If you see toque , with qu replacing the c , it is
to maintain the k sound.
Llegar , for example, has a hard g sound, which must be preserved. If
you see llegue , with gu replacing the g , it is to maintain the hard g
sound.
```
#### Castilian Spanish

There are only a few differences in pronunciation between the Spanish
spoken in Latin America and that spoken in Spain.

- Both the **c** that precedes **e** or **i** and the **z** have the _th_ sound heard in
    English _thought_ and _thing_.


- When **j** or **g** precedes **e** or **i** , it has a slightly more guttural sound.

```
Tips for Pronunciation
```
- While practicing, remember to keep the vowel sounds short and
    clear.
- Always use the Spanish **r** sound. Resist the use of the English r.
- Implode the sounds of **p** and **t**. Make sure there is no puff of air.
- Always pronounce **z** like the letter **s**.
- Give the syllables an almost equal emphasis, a sort of staccato
    sound. Pronounce every syllable clearly and precisely in order
    to develop an even speech pattern.

### Greetings and Salutations


# I

# Elements of a Sentence


# 1

# Nouns, Articles, and Adjectives

## The Gender of Nouns and the Definite

## Article

A noun is a person, place, or thing.
In Spanish, all nouns are either _masculine_ or _feminine_.
In Spanish, the definite article (English _the_ ) agrees with the noun in
gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural): **el, la, los,
las**.

## Singular Nouns

##### Masculine

The masculine singular noun takes the definite article **el**.

Most nouns that end in **-o** are masculine. Pronounce the following
words aloud.


Many masculine nouns do not end in **-o** ; therefore, it is necessary to learn
each noun with its article.

Some masculine nouns end in **-a** or **-ma**.

#### Feminine

The feminine singular noun takes the definite article **la**.

Most nouns that end in **-a** are feminine. Pronounce the following words
aloud.

Nouns that end in **-ción, -sión, -dad, -tad** , or **-tud** are feminine.


A few nouns that end in **-o** are feminine.

Many feminine nouns do not follow these patterns; therefore, it is
important to learn each noun with its article.

#### Exercise 1.1

_Write the appropriate masculine or feminine form of the definite article for
each of the following nouns. As you write the answer, make sure you know
the meaning of the word_.


A noun ending in **-ista** can be masculine or feminine, depending on
whether it refers to a male or a female. The article indicates the gender of
the noun.

A noun ending in **-nte** can be masculine or feminine, depending on
whether it refers to a male or a female. The article indicates the gender of
the noun.


#### Plural Nouns

##### Masculine

A masculine noun that ends in a vowel adds **-s** to form the plural; it takes
the definite article **los**.

If the noun ends in a consonant, **el** changes to **los** and the noun adds **-es**.


#### Feminine

A feminine noun that ends in a vowel adds **-s** to form the plural; it takes
the definite article **las**.

If the noun ends in a consonant, **la** changes to **las** and the noun adds **-es**.

#### Exercise 1.2

_Write the plural form of each of the following singular nouns_.


### The Indefinite Article

The Spanish singular indefinite article (English _a, an_ ) is **un** before a
masculine noun and **una** before a feminine noun. Pronounce the words in
the following lists aloud. By learning these nouns, you are building your
vocabulary.

#### Singular Indefinite Articles


#### Plural Indefinite Articles

The Spanish plural indefinite article (English _some_ ) is **unos** before a
masculine plural noun and **unas** before a feminine plural noun.

#### Masculine

#### Feminine

#### Exercise 1.3


_Translate the following nouns into English. Remember to practice
pronouncing the words_.


### Adjectives

An adjective is a word that describes a noun.

A Spanish adjective agrees in gender and number with the noun it
modifies. In Spanish, an adjective almost always follows the noun it
describes.

#### Singular Form of Adjectives


Adjectives that end in **-o** are _masculine_ in form and agree with a masculine
noun. As you pronounce the following examples aloud, note that the
_adjective follows the noun_ it describes.

Adjectives that end in **-o** change the **-o** to **-a** when describing a feminine
noun.

Adjectives that do not end in **-o** have the same form for describing both
masculine and feminine nouns. It doesn’t matter what letter ends the
adjective, as long as it is not **_-_** **o**.


#### Key Vocabulary

##### Los colores (The colors)

#### Other Adjectives

#### Exercise 1.4


_Complete the following phrases with the following Spanish adjective_.

#### Plural Form of Adjectives

Adjectives that end in a vowel add **-s** to form the plural.


Adjectives that end in a consonant add **-es** to form the plural.

Adjectives agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. Review
each singular and plural form as you pronounce the following nouns and
the adjectives that describe them.

#### Masculine

#### Feminine


#### Exercise 1.5

_Write the plural form of each of the following noun and adjective phrases_.

#### Exercise 1.6

_Translate the following phrases into Spanish_.



# 2

# Estar, Ser , and Subject Pronouns

## Subject Pronouns


There is no subject pronoun _it_ in Spanish. **Él** and **ella** refer to people and
sometimes to animals, but not to things.

### Estar (to be)

Spanish has two verbs that are equivalent to English _to be_. Begin with the
conjugation of the verb **estar**.


Practice the conjugations of the verb aloud. Notice that **él, ella** , and **Ud.**
have the same form of the verb (the third-person singular). Notice also
that **ellos, ellas** , and **Uds.** have the same form of the verb (the third-person
plural).

**Estar** is used to express four basic concepts: location, health, changing
mood or condition, and personal opinion in terms of taste or appearance.

**- Location**

```
Estar is used to describe where something or someone is physically
located.
```
```
The verb, which carries the action of the phrase, is the essential
element of the Spanish sentence or question because of the amount of
information it contains.
```
```
Verb Definitions
```
```
The infinitive is the unconjugated form of the verb. For example, to
be is an infinitive in English. The conjugations are the forms of the
verb that belong to a particular pronoun or noun subject. I am and he
is are examples of conjugations of the infinitive to be.
```

```
Often the pronouns yo, tú , and nosotros are omitted. This is possible
because estoy can only mean I am , estás means you are whether tú is
included or not, and estamos carries the meaning we are.
```
**- Personal opinion in terms of taste or appearance**

```
When estar is used with food, the English equivalent is taste or tastes.
When estar is used with appearance, the English equivalent is look or
looks.
```
```
A Word About Word Order
```

```
As you begin learning the basic structure of the Spanish language,
you will discover that the word order of English and Spanish is
essentially the same for the material covered in Part I, which includes
the basic elements of a sentence.
```
#### Key Vocabulary

These words will help enhance your ability to communicate. As you learn
them, remember to practice them aloud.

### Interrogative Words

#### Adverbs of Location

#### Adjectives


```
NOTE: Guapo describes people only; bonito, hermoso , and lindo are used
to describe both people and things.
```
#### Exercise 2.1

```
Complete the following sentences with the correct form of estar. Pay
attention to the meaning of each sentence. Then indicate whether the
sentence expresses health, location, changing mood, or changing
condition.
```
1. Daniel ________________ muy cansado hoy. (________________)
2. El teléfono y el libro ________________ en la mesa.
    (________________)
3. La mujer ________________ bien; el hombre ________________
    enfermo. (________________)
4. ¿Cómo ________________ Uds.? (________________)
5. ¿Dónde ________________ ellos? (________________)
6. ¿Dónde ________________ el baño, por favor? (________________)
7. El niño ________________ enojado y la niña ________________
    triste. (________________)
8. Los muchachos ________________ alegres. (________________)
9. Yo ________________ contento. (________________)
10. ¿Quién ________________ aquí? (________________)

#### Exercise 2.2

```
Translate the following sentences into Spanish.
```
1. _I am in the yellow house. Where are you?_


###### _______________________________________________________

2. _The red blouses are in the big store_.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
3. _The white flower is in the window_.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
4. _We are in the train_.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
5. _How are you? I am fine, thanks_.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
6. _We are tired, and we are happy_.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
### Ser (to be)

The Spanish verb **ser** is also equivalent to English _to be_.

```
In English, there is a single verb that means to be. We say, for example:
```
The verb is the same in both cases. But in Spanish, there is a difference,
and you have to choose the correct verb.


**Ser** is used to express seven basic concepts: description, profession, point
of origin, identification, material, possession or ownership, and where an
event takes place.

**- Description
- Profession**

```
Spanish does not translate a/an when stating an unmodified profession.
```
**- Point of origin**

```
De here means from.
```

```
In common English usage, we often end a sentence with a preposition,
for example, Where are you from? This never occurs in Spanish; the
preposition cannot ever end a sentence, so the preposition, in this case
de , is placed in front of the interrogative word dónde.
```
**- Identification**

```
Identification specifies characteristics such as relationship, nationality,
race, or religion.
```
**- Material**

```
De here means of.
```
**- Possession or ownership**


```
NOTE: The contraction: de + el ( of + the ) = del. There are only two
contractions in the Spanish language; del is one of them. Use de
(English of ) to express possession or ownership. When de (English of )
is followed by the masculine el (English the ), the words contract to del ,
meaning of the.
```
```
A Word About Possessives
```
```
You can see that the translations above are not exact. There is no
apostrophe in Spanish, so when you think of Peter’s car , for example,
the Spanish structure is el carro de Pedro ( the car of Peter ). Make
sure you understand this concept and use whichever English
translation seems clearest to you.
```
**- Where an event takes place**


```
The equivalent English translation is take or takes place.
```
```
The party takes place at Joe’s house.
The concert takes place at the club.
The protest takes place in the capital.
```
#### Exercise 2.3

_Complete the following sentences with the appropriate form of_ **ser** _in each
blank. Indicate whether the sentence expresses description, profession,
point of origin, identification, material, or possession in parentheses_.

1. El café ________________ de Colombia. (________________)
2. Ellos ________________ doctores. Ella ________________

# Hay , Interrogative Words, Days,

# and Months

## Hay

The single Spanish word **hay** (pronounced like English _eye_ ) means _there
is, there are, is there?_ , and _are there?_ in English.

Spanish sentences with **hay** and English sentences with _there is, there
are_ follow the same pattern with regard to the inclusion or omission of
definite and indefinite articles. The Spanish definite articles **el, la, los** , and
**las** (English _the_ ) never follow **hay**.

A question formed with **hay** uses the same word order as a statement.
When written, it carries a question mark at the beginning and end, as all
Spanish interrogative sentences do. When spoken, it should be pronounced
with a rising intonation.


When **hay** is followed by a plural noun, the article is omitted.

To make a sentence negative, place **no** before **hay**.

### Days of the Week, Months, and Seasons

##### Los días de la semana (The days of the week)

To refer to a day of the week in English, we say _Monday_ or _on Monday_. In
Spanish, the article **el** is used with the name of the day to express this idea.
Days of the week are not capitalized in Spanish.

To form the plural of the days of the week, **el** changes to **los** and **-s** is
added only to **el sábado** and **el domingo**. The names of the days of the
week from **el lunes** to **el viernes** already end in **-s**.

# Numbers, Dates, and Time

## Cardinal Numbers

A cardinal number is any number that expresses an amount, such as _one,
two, three_. Here are the Spanish cardinal numbers up to 100.


Note the following rules for the use of cardinal numbers in Spanish.

- Numbers after 15, **quince** , are formed by combining numbers: 10 + 6 =
    16, **diez y seis son dieciséis**.
- The numbers from 16 to 19 and from 21 to 29 are expressed as one
    word: 22, **veinte y dos**  **veintidós**.
- Numbers after 30, **treinta** , end in **-a** and do not combine with the next
    number. They are expressed as individual words: 34, **treinta y cuatro** ,
    for example. This is true for the numbers 31 to 99, **treinta y uno** to
    **noventa y nueve**.
- In English we say _one hundred and ten_. Spanish does not use **y** to
    connect hundreds and the following number: 110, **ciento diez** ; 220,
    **doscientos veinte** ; 315, **trescientos quince**.


- When a masculine noun follows the number 21, 31, 41, 51, 61, 71, 81,
    or 91, the **-o** is dropped from **uno**.
- When a feminine noun follows a number ending in **uno** (English _one_ ),
    the feminine form is **una**.
- The number 100 in Spanish uses the following pattern.

```
Cien becomes ciento if it is followed by any number less than itself.
Before all nouns, masculine or feminine, it remains cien.
```
- The numbers 200 to 900 agree with the noun they modify.


- Spanish numbers beginning with 1000, **mil** , are not counted in
    hundreds.


**Mil** does not change ( **dos mil, tres mil, cinco mil** ), nor does it need the
article **un** (English _a_ ) in front of it.

Spanish does not count in hundreds after 1,000. The number 1992 is
formed by combining 1000 + 900 + 92: **mil novecientos noventa y dos**.
The number 2006 is **dos mil seis**.

The plural **miles** is used only to refer to a large but inexact amount, the
way English uses _tons_ : **Hay miles de personas en el restaurante.** _There
are tons of people in the restaurant_.

- Note that Spanish uses the period to separate thousands; the comma is
    used to indicate decimals: $90,25 is **noventa dólares y veinticinco**
    **centavos**.

```
A Word About Numbers
```
```
Numbers are an important part of everyday life. People tell you their
telephone numbers or ask you to meet them at a specific address. Try
to practice numbers with a partner, perhaps a native speaker.
```
#### Exercise 4.1

_Complete the following sentences by writing in the Spanish numbers (in
words)_.

1. En febrero, hay ___________________ (28) días; cada
    ___________________ (4) años, hay ___________________ (29)
    días.


2. ¿En qué meses hay ___________________ (31) días?
3. Hay ___________________ (7) días en una semana;
    ___________________ (52) semanas en un año.
4. Hay ___________________ (76) lápices en la tienda y
    ___________________ (67) plumas.
5. Hay ___________________ (21) muchachas en el baño, pero hay
    solamente ___________________ (1) espejo.
6. Hay _____________________ (135) libros de español en la librería.
7. En la biblioteca, hay _______________________ (2,456) libros.
8. ___________________ (91) y _____________________ (542) son
    _____________________ (633).
9. _____________________ (860) menos ___________________ (50)
    son _____________________ (810).
10. Hay ___________________ (100) camisas rojas en la tienda y hay
___________________ (100) pantalones.
11. Hay ___________________ (15) capítulos en el libro; hay
_____________________ (254) páginas.
12. Hay _____________________ (235) restaurantes en la ciudad.

### Ordinal Numbers

```
Ordinal numbers express position in a series, such as first, second, third.
```
```
Note the following rules for the use of ordinal numbers in Spanish.
```
- Ordinal numbers in Spanish precede the noun and agree in gender with
    the noun they describe.


- **Primero** and **tercero** drop the **-o** before a masculine noun: **el primer**
    **piso, el tercer piso**.


- Ordinal numbers are used for kings, queens, popes, and centuries; in
    this case, they follow the noun they describe.


- Beginning with the ordinal number _eleventh_ , state the noun first, then
    the cardinal number. Thus _Eleventh Street_ is expressed as **la calle once**
    (English _the street eleven_ ).

#### Exercise 4.2

_Complete the following sentences with the Spanish equivalent (in words)
of each phrase_.

1. Hay una biblioteca en ___________________ ( _72nd Street_ ).
2. El trabajo de Lola está en ___________________ ( _the 40th floor_ ).
3. Hay un restaurante en ___________________ ( _135th Street_ ).
4. ___________________ ( _The third chapter_ ) es interesante.
5. ___________________ ( _The fourth lesson_ ) es horrible.
6. Mayo es ___________________ ( _the fifth month_ ) del año.

### The Date

Spanish uses the cardinal numbers 2 to 31 to indicate all days of the month
except the first.


Spanish uses an ordinal number only to indicate the _first of the month_ , **el
primero del mes**.

#### Exercise 4.3

_Complete the following sentences with the Spanish term or number. Always
write numbers as words_.

1. Hoy es __________________ ( _Thursday_ ), el __________________
    ( _11th_ ) de mayo.
2. ¿Por qué estamos en clase __________________ ( _on Saturdays_ )?
3. Hay __________________ ( _100_ ) personas en el restaurante nuevo.
4. La fecha del nacimiento de Sandra es __________________
    __________________ ( _Oct. 18, 1973_ ).
5. Es el __________________ ( _14th_ ) de diciembre del
    __________________ ( _2006_ ).
6. ¿Quién es el __________________ ( _first_ ) hombre y la
    __________________ ( _first_ ) mujer?

### Telling Time

To express _time_ in the sense of _telling time_ , Spanish uses **la hora**.


In order to tell time, Spanish always uses the third-person singular or
plural of **ser**. Start by learning the expressions for telling exact time on the
hour, from one o’clock to twelve o’clock. **La** represents **la hora** , and **las**
represents **las horas**.

The part of day is specified as follows.

To indicate the exact hour or “sharp,” Spanish uses **exactamente** or **en
punto**.


To indicate an approximate time, Spanish uses **a eso de** + the hour or the
hour + **más o menos**.

To express a time _after_ the hour, state the hour + **y** (English _and, plus_ ) +
the number of minutes. This adds the minutes to the hour.

When it is a _quarter_ after the hour, Spanish uses **quince** (English _fifteen_ )
or **cuarto** (English _quarter_ ).

When it is _half_ past the hour, Spanish uses **treinta** (English _thirty_ ) or
**media** (English _half_ ).


To express a time _before_ the hour, state the hour + **menos** (English _minus_ )
+ the number of minutes. This subtracts the minutes from the hour.

An alternate way to express time _before_ the hour is to state the number of
minutes + **para** + the hour. This expression, which closely follows English
syntax, is not a full sentence.

To indicate that something is happening _at_ a certain time, Spanish uses an
expression with the preposition **a** (English _at_ ).


The expressions for _after_ the hour (the hour + **y** + the number of minutes)
and _before_ the hour (the hour + **menos** + the number of minutes) remain
the same after **a**.

#### Exercise 4.4

```
A. Complete the following sentences with the appropriate Spanish time.
Include de la mañana, de la tarde , or de la noche , and always write
numbers as words.
```
1. El programa es ____________________ ( _at 6 P.M_ .).

# Regular Verbs

All Spanish verbs belong to one of three classifications, called
conjugations, depending on the ending of the infinitive.

All infinitives end in **-ar, -er** , or **-ir**.
Each conjugation has its own set of endings that are added to the stem
of the verb.

Verbs are considered _regular_ if there is _no change in the stem_ when it is
conjugated.

## Uses of the Present Tense

The present tense is used to express the English simple present ( _I sing_ ) and
the English present progressive tense ( _I am singing_ ).


Questions are formed by inverting the subject and the verb. In this case,
the translation of the Spanish present tense includes the English helping
verb _do_. Questions can also be indicated by rising intonation, without a
change in word order.

The present tense can be used to express a future event if an adverbial
expression of future time is included.

To make a sentence negative, place **no** directly before the verb.

### -Ar Verbs

To conjugate a regular **-ar** verb in the present tense, drop the infinitive
ending and add **-o, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, -an** to the stem.


```
A Word About Pronunciation
```
```
It is important to pronounce Spanish precisely and correctly. All
words that end in the vowels a, e, i, o, u , or the consonants n or s
have their natural stress on the second-to-last, or penultimate,
syllable. Make sure you pronounce the verbs this way: yo canto, tú
cantas, él canta, nosotros cantamos, ellos cantan. If a word carries
an accent mark, you will stress that syllable: vosotros cantáis , for
example.
```
#### Frequently Used -ar Verbs


**A Word About Verbs**

```
The verbs above are presented with full conjugations so that you can
practice and learn them one by one. These verbs form an essential
base for all future studies. All three forms of both the third-person
singular and the third-person plural conjugations have the same
endings. From this point forward, only one pronoun will be used for
each singular or plural third-person conjugation.
```

**Pronunciation Reminder**

```
The Spanish d is pronounced like the d in English dog when it
appears at the beginning of a breath group or follows an l or n :
donde, la falda, el conde. In all other cases, the Spanish d is
pronounced like the soft th sound in English other. Practice estudiar
with a th sound.
```

**Pronunciation Reminder**

```
The ll in Spanish is pronounced like the y in English beyond , or the s
in English pleasure.
```
**Pronunciation Reminder**

```
Stress the penultimate syllable of the conjugated verb: tra ba jo,
tra ba jas , tra ba ja, trabajamos, tra ba jan.
```

```
Pronunciation Reminder
```
```
The v in Spanish is pronounced like the b in English boy.
```
#### The Preposition a

The preposition **a** means _to_ in English.

When **a** is followed by the masculine **el** (meaning _the_ ), the words
contract to **al** (meaning _to the_ ). This is one of only two contractions in
Spanish.

A contraction is _not_ formed when **a** is followed by the feminine **la** or by
the plural articles **los** or **las**.

La ciudad es muy linda, con calles estrechas y casas del estilo español.
Hay unas plazas hermosas y muchas iglesias. Vivimos en las montañas y
estamos a tres millas de° la ciudad. Laura y yo caminamos treinta minutos

día en el campo porque estudia las civilizaciones antiguas. El padre de

pasa la mañana en un restaurante bonito donde él toma uno o dos cafés
más; lee un periódico y habla con la gente. Ellos hablan bien el español,
pero Laura y yo no hablamos mucho; estudiamos en la escuela secundaria
porque necesitamos practicar más.
Laura y yo decidimos tomar un curso de historia de México, una clase
de baile, una clase donde los estudiantes aprenden canciones mexicanas y
aprenden a tocar la guitarra. Guanajuato está ubicada° en las montañas y la
clase de baile es difícil porque es trabajoso° respirar° en las montañas. Las
clases de música son fantásticas porque hablamos y practicamos la

the present tense.

## -Ar Verbs

Irregular verbs that end in **-ar** have two possible changes in their stem.
The endings are the same as those you have learned for the regular verbs:
add **-o, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, -an** to the stem.

## Stem Change e > ie

#### Reading Comprehension

##### El tren

El tren llega a tiempo como siempre. Llega a las cuatro y veintiséis. Subo
al tren con algunas personas y viajo a la ciudad.

Cerca de mí, una mujer duerme. Ella descansa completamente. Pienso
que tiene sueños dulces. Un hombre lee un periódico. Las noticias son
interesantes hoy; él lee con mucho interés. ¿Qué lee? ¿Está interesado en
los deportes o los negocios o los eventos internacionales? Es imposible
saber. Un niño grita y después sonríe. Un hombre a mi lado escribe cartas
de amor. Otras personas hablan por teléfono. Hablan y hablan. Ellos tienen
muchos amigos. Trato de escuchar las conversaciones. A veces, quiero
hablar con alguien pero prefiero viajar sola con mis libros y mis
cuadernos.
El tren llega a la ciudad a las cinco y cuatro. Camino con la
muchedumbre hacia las salidas. La estación del tren es grande y hermosa.
Hay restaurantes en el sótano y farmacias y tiendas en el primer piso.
Salgo de la estación. No hay mucho sol, menos mal. La gente pasa. El
tiempo pasa. ¿Qué hago ahora, con muchas posibilidades? (Prefiero el
campo donde hay menos decisiones.) ¿Qué hago yo después de mi viaje en
el tren? Hay teatro y cine, conciertos y museos. Puedo comer en un buen
restaurante o escuchar música gratis en el parque. ¿En qué dirección
camino? No, es mejor volver al tren; en el tren todo es seguro. Siempre
sale y llega a su destino. El próximo tren sale precisamente a las cinco y
veinte. Afortunadamente, hay tiempo.

Es la hora pico. Corro con la muchedumbre al tren. Subimos. Tomamos
asiento. Abrimos los libros, las revistas, los periódicos y descansamos,
contentos de estar de nuevo en el tren.

Spanish **que** (English _that, which_ , or _who_ ) is the most common relative
pronoun in everyday speech. **Que** can refer to persons or things, either
singular or plural.

The relative pronoun **que** can also be used after prepositions. As the object
of a preposition, **que** refers to a thing or things only. It does not refer to a
person or persons.

#### The Conjunction que

One of the uses of conjunctions is to join two sentences into a single
sentence. Spanish **que** (English _that_ ) used as a conjunction may join a
main clause and a dependent (or subordinate) clause to form a sentence or
question.


```
A Word About que
```
```
The English word that , whether it is used as a relative pronoun or as a
conjunction, is often omitted. For example, it is correct in English to
say either the program I see or the program that I see , and to say I
think the lesson is easy or I think that the lesson is easy. In Spanish,
que is never omitted.
```
#### The Preposition para

**Para** has two meanings in English.

- _for_
- _in order to_

#### Exercise 7.6


_Complete the following sentences by translating the English phrase in
parentheses_.

1. Ella viene a la clase ____________________ ( _in order to learn_ ).
2. Yo sé ____________________ ( _that she is here_ ).
3. El hombre ____________________ ( _who lives here_ ) es guapo.
4. ¿Piensa Ud. ____________________ ( _that I should go_ )?
5. Él practica ____________________ ( _in order to play_ ) el piano.
6. ¿ ____________________ ( _for whom_ ) es la pregunta?
7. Las llaves ____________________ ( _that I need_ ) están en el carro.
8. ¿Tiene Ud. una habitación ____________________ ( _for two persons_ )?

#### Key Vocabulary

These words will help enhance your ability to communicate. As you learn
them, remember to practice them aloud.

#### Las partes del cuerpo (Parts of the Body)


#### Dentro del cuerpo (Inside the body)


```
In Spanish, the definite articles el, la, los , and las are used more
frequently than the possessive adjective, especially with parts of the
body. In English we would use a possessive adjective ( my, your, his,
her, our, their ).
```
#### La familia

As you learn the names for family members, you will see that the plural
takes the masculine form when it includes more than one male or a male
and female pair. For example, **el padre** means _the father_ ; **la madre** means
_the mother_. The _father_ and _mother_ together are the _parents_ , which in
Spanish is expressed as **los padres**.


### Time Expressions with hacer

To ask _how long_ someone has been doing something, Spanish uses the
present tense. The translation of this construction is equivalent to the
present perfect tense in English. The action begins in the past and
continues into the present.


To answer the question of _how long_ someone has been doing something,
Spanish uses the following expression.

```
A Word About “How Long”
```
```
The hace + the length of time + que + the verb in the present tense
construction looks complicated because the English translation uses
the present perfect tense. But in Spanish, whenever you want to
express how long someone has been doing something, just use the
present tense.

#### Reading Comprehension

##### La cita

```
La sala de espera de este doctor es muy grande porque trabaja solo. Debe
tener mucho éxito porque tiene tres secretarias que contestan sus llamadas,
hacen las citas, dan consejos sobre los seguros médicos y organizan su
horario. Confieso que la sala de espera es común; tiene una mesa como
cualquier otra, con revistas de moda para las mujeres y revistas de
deportes para los hombres. Hay una mesita con una lámpara en cada
rincón del cuarto. Son las dos menos quince. Tomo asiento y escojo una de
las revistas.
```

Un hombre amable entra. Él debe tener la primera cita de la tarde. En
seguida, una viejecita llega con su hija y toman asiento cerca de mí. Logro
escuchar su conversación. La madre tiene dolor de cabeza; su hija no
camina bien. Un hombre con el brazo roto entra; después, un muchacho
que tiene problemas con el tobillo, una mujer con dolor del cuello y de la
espalda, y un hombre simpático con dolor del estómago. Algunos están
tranquilos, pero la mayoría de ellos están inquietos. Miran sus relojes a
menudo; tratan de leer pero no pueden; tratan de hacer conversación para
pasar el tiempo. Mientras tanto, la gente llega y llega y llega. Parece que
no va a caber ninguna persona más en la sala pequeña. Pero vienen más y
más hasta llenar todo el cuarto con pacientes.

Son las dos y media. Por fin, el doctor emerge de su oficina. La
secretaria empieza a leer los nombres que están en su lista. Al escuchar su
nombre, cada persona desaparece en la oficina por un rato, sale del
consultorio, hace otra cita antes de volver a casa. Sigue así toda la tarde.

```
La secretaria ve que todavía estoy aquí. Tenemos esta conversación:

# Adjectives and Adverbs

## Possessive Adjectives

Possessive adjectives in Spanish agree in gender and number with the
noun they modify. Possessive adjectives precede the noun they modify.

**mi, mis** _my_

**tu, tus** _your_ ( **tú** form)

**su, sus** _your_ ( **Ud.** form), _his, her, their_

In Spanish, there is only one form for the third-person possessive: the **su**
and **sus** form. **Su** is used before a singular noun to show possession; **sus** is
used with a plural noun. Because **su** / **sus** can be very ambiguous, the form
that you have already learned and used—the noun + **de** + the pronoun—
can be used to clarify the meaning.


**nuestro, nuestra, nuestros, nuestras** _our_

**vuestro, vuestra, vuestros, vuestras** _your_ ( **vosotros** form)

Like **vosotros** , this form is used only in Spain. It is explained here so that
you will be aware of it, but when you need a word for _your_ in Spanish, use
**su** or **sus**.

#### Exercise 8.1

#### Demonstrative Adjectives

```
In Spanish, there are three demonstrative adjectives; they agree in number
and gender with the nouns they modify.
```

#### Neuter Demonstrative Pronouns


Neuter demonstrative pronouns refer to an object that is not known, a
statement, or a general idea.

#### Exercise 8.2

_Complete the following sentences using demonstrative adjectives_.

1. ___________ revista que tú lees es interesante, pero ___________
    artículo tiene más información. ( _this/that_ )

    repeticiones? ( _those_ )

#### Adjectives of Nationality

When an adjective of nationality ends in a consonant, **-a** is added to form
the feminine.


In all other cases, the adjectives of nationality will follow the rules you
have already learned. Adjectives that end in **-o** change to **-a** when
describing a feminine noun.


Adjectives that end in vowels other than **-o** do not change.



#### Adjectives That Precede a Noun

In Chapter 1, you learned that adjectives follow the nouns they describe.
Now you will learn the few adjectives that precede the noun they modify.
Remember that adjectives agree in number and gender with the noun they
describe.

Two frequently used adjectives, **bueno** and **malo** , drop the **-o** before a
masculine singular noun.

```
Bueno and malo can follow the noun as well as precede it. The use is
less frequent, though, and the description loses intensity.
```
##### Adjectives That Express Quantity




##### Adjectives That Express Next, Only , and Last

##### Adjectives Whose Meaning Depends on Position

Some adjectives have different meanings depending on whether they
precede or follow the noun they modify.


```
When mismo follows a noun or pronoun, it intensifies the word it
describes. For example:
esta casa misma this very house
yo mismo I myself
el doctor mismo está enfermo the doctor himself is sick
ahora mismo right now
```

#### Adverbs

```
Adverbs describe verbs or adjectives. In Spanish, adverbs are formed by
adding -mente to the feminine form of the adjective. The suffix -mente
corresponds to the English suffix -ly.
To change the adjective perfecto to an adverb, use the feminine form
perfecta and add -mente. The result is the adverb perfectamente.
```

If an adjective does not end in **-o** , it has only one form for both masculine
and feminine. To form an adverb from these adjectives, simply add **-mente**
to the adjective.

If there are two adverbs in a series, only the final one will add **-mente**. The
first one in the series takes the feminine form of the adjective.

#### Exercise 8.7

_Change the following adjectives to their corresponding adverbial form_.


#### Adverbs That Do Not Take the Suffix -mente

##### Adverbs of Quantity

##### Adverbs That Tell How Something Is Done

##### Adverbs of Time and Place


##### Adverbs of Direction

#### Exercise 8.8

_Complete the following sentences with the adverb in parentheses_.

1. Llego al trabajo a las siete de la mañana; _______________ llego
    _______________. ( _always/early_ )
2. Para hablar _______________ el español, tengo que pronunciar
    _______________. ( _well/clearly_ )


3. ¿Corre ella _______________? ( _slowly_ )
4. Todo el mundo quiere vivir _______________. ( _happily_ )
5. Simón y Teresa viajan cada mes. Viajan _______________.
    ( _frequently_ )
6. ¿Puede Ud. comer después de su operación? _______________. ( _not_
    _yet_ )
7. ¿Necesita Ud. ayuda con sus problemas? _______________. ( _no_
    _longer_ )
8. ¿Dónde están los niños? ¿Están _______________ o
    _______________? ( _upstairs/downstairs_ )

    ( _quickly/happily_ )

12. _______________ , hay un río. ( _straight ahead_ )
13. ¿A que hora llegamos _______________? ( _there_ )
14. Hablo _______________ y _______________. ( _honestly/sincerely_ )

#### Reading Comprehension

##### La fiesta

Esta noche hay una fiesta en la casa de una conocida. Tengo la invitación
encima del piano que ya no toco. No sé si quiero ir. La fiesta empieza a las
ocho. Pienso que los invitados van a llegar a las nueve. (No sé porque las
invitaciones siempre llevan la hora equivocada. Si ella sabe que vamos a
llegar después de las nueve, ¿por qué escribe que empieza a las ocho?)

¿Cómo imagino la fiesta? Primero hay música. Con mucho cuidado, los
anfitriones ponen música alegre. La casa está limpia y hay entremeses y
bocadillos en la mesa. Hay mucho que beber también: vino y cerveza,
vodka y tequila. Hay soda y gaseosa, agua mineral y jugo para la gente que
no quiere tomar alcohol. Después de mucha preparación, todo está listo.
Al entrar, los invitados sonríen y ponen las botellas de vino que llevan
consigo en la mesa. La gente empieza a hablar, un poquito al principio, y
mientras que toman, hablan más y más y en voz más y más alta. Ponen la
música en alto volumen y algunas parejas empiezan a bailar. Las personas
que saben la letra de las canciones cantan. Todo el mundo está muy alegre.
Pasan unas horas y la anfitriona va a la cocina. Apagan las luces; ella
vuelve con una torta de chocolate con velas y todos los amigos cantan
‘Cumpleaños Feliz’.

Voy a mi alcoba a mirar mi vestuario. Mi cuarto es muy tranquilo, con
una brisa que viene del mar. Las paredes son de un color azul celeste que
produce calma. El ambiente es relajante, un ambiente de quietud. Es una


habitación cómoda donde descanso, leo y miro la televisión todas las
noches. Son las ocho ya. Va a empezar mi programa favorito en media
hora.

# Negatives and Prepositions

## Negatives

You already know how to make a sentence negative by placing **no** directly
before the first verb.

The following list of negative words adds to this base.

Learn the affirmative words also.


**nada** _nothing_

```
To form a negative sentence, no precedes the first verb and nada
follows it.
```
```
A Word About Negatives
```
```
You can see that Spanish, unlike English, uses a double negative. In
fact, a Spanish sentence can include three or four negatives. The
more negatives you use, the more negative the sentence becomes.
```
**nadie** _no one_


```
No precedes the verb and nadie follows it.
```
**nunca, jamás** _never_

```
No precedes the verb and nunca or jamás follows it. Both nunca and
jamás mean never.
```
```
Nunca and jamás can also be placed directly before the first verb with
no change in the meaning.
```
**ninguno** _not one, no_

```
No precedes the verb and ninguno follows it.
Ninguno is the only negative expression in the list above that is an
adjective. This means that it must agree in number and gender with the
noun it modifies. Ninguno shortens to ningún before a masculine
singular noun. Ninguno is not used in the plural unless the noun it
modifies is always used in the plural, such as vacaciones.
```

#### Exercise 9.1

_Answer the following questions in the negative_.

1. ¿Aprenden Uds. algo en México? No, ___________________
2. ¿Cuántas personas van a su fiesta? ___________________
3. ¿Escuchas siempre las noticias? No, ___________________
4. ¿Tienen ellos muchos enemigos? No, ___________________
5. ¿Hay un hospital aquí? No, ___________________
6. ¿Vas a viajar? No, ___________________
7. ¿Es la película algo cómica? No, ___________________
8. ¿Bailas a veces? No, ___________________



In Spanish, unlike English, the more negatives you use, the more

```
negative the sentence becomes.
```

1. Yo tengo más de treinta dólares en mi cartera.

```

6. ¿Por qué siempre corres al tren?

#### Prepositions

```
A preposition shows the relationship of a noun or a pronoun to some other
word in a sentence, clause, or phrase. You already know the most
commonly used prepositions.
```

In general, prepositions are followed by verbs in the infinitive form,
nouns, or pronouns.

```
An infinitive that follows a preposition in Spanish is often translated
with the English gerund ( thinking , for example). In Spanish, the verb is
always the infinitive (for example, pensar , to think ).
```
#### Prepositions Followed by Verbs or Nouns


#### Prepositions Followed by Nouns or Pronouns

```
Hacia can be combined with an adverb with the following meanings.
```

```
Sobre means on top of, about a theme or topic. It can also mean about
in the sense of approximately.
```
**Desde** means _from_ if you have a specific point of departure in terms of
place or time.

In addition to simple prepositions, there are many compound prepositions
that are followed by nouns or pronouns. The list below includes both
types.


#### Pronouns That Follow Prepositions

You have already learned that subject pronouns follow prepositions.

The only exceptions appear in the first-person and second-person singular.

There are a few situations, however, where the subject pronouns **tú** and **yo**
are used after prepositions. Note the following expressions.


The only preposition that combines with a pronoun is **con**.

### The Preposition por

**Por** has the following meanings.


**Por** adds the idea of motion to prepositions of location.

**Por** appears in some common expressions.


#### Por and para Compared

Remember that **para** means _for_.

**Para** is also used to express a specific time limit or deadline in the future.
In this context, it can be translated as _for, by, on_ , or _before_.

**Por** is translated as simple _for_ only when **por** precedes a quantity of time.


```
With the exception of their English translations as for , the meanings of
por and para do not overlap. Again, por means for only when it precedes
a period of time. Para means for in almost all other cases.
```
#### Exercise 9.4

pronouns.

#### Reading Comprehension

##### El circo

```
Aunque ella tiene cuarenta años, mi amiga Leonora quiere trabajar en un
circo. Es verdad que ella es soltera y maestra y tiene el verano libre pero
no entiendo por qué ella no quiere ir al Caribe o a cualquier sitio relajante.
Ella piensa que va a ser una gran aventura. Hay una gira del circo por el
noreste de los Estados Unidos y ella va a pasar todo el verano con ellos.
Yo soy soltera también y tengo el verano libre, pero no tengo el menor
interés en el circo. ¡Es absurdo! ¿Qué hay que hacer en un circo? Según
Leonora, ella va a vender tiquetes por la mañana. Después de almorzar, va
a mirar algunos ensayos y a hablar con los trapecistas. Desde las dos de la
tarde hasta las siete, ella y sus colegas van a vender más tiquetes por
teléfono y en persona. A eso de las ocho de la noche, al escuchar la música
que indica que el circo va a empezar, Leonora va a cerrar la oficina y salir
para ir a ver la función. El colmo es que va a ganar solamente trescientos
dólares por semana. Ella sale mañana. Por mi parte, prefiero pasar el
verano aquí. Es bonito, hace buen tiempo y tengo otras amigas. De todos
modos, ella va a volver pronto.

#### Reading Comprehension

##### El trabajo

No voy al trabajo hoy, ni mañana, ni pasado mañana. No tengo ganas. Mi
oficina es demasiado oscura. Cuando entro, finjo que estoy bien y que
entiendo como funcionan todas las máquinas que están allí, pero en
realidad, no entiendo nada. El cambio de un año a otro es impresionante.
Ahora no hay espacio ni para mis plantas ni para mis fotos. Hay una
computadora encima de la mesa y una impresora entre la máquina de
facsímile y la contestadora. El papel está debajo de la mesa; mis plumas y
mis lápices están al lado de la computadora. Yo sé que tengo que aprender
a usar todo para tener éxito en este nuevo mundo de la tecnología.

Durante el día, si mi jefe quiere hablar conmigo, él no sale de su
oficina. (Él está a solo veinte pasos de mi oficina.) Ya no habla conmigo
cara a cara. ¡No! Él manda un correo electrónico desde su oficina. Ya no
escucho su voz bella y expresiva. Ya no viene a mi cuartito para conversar
conmigo, ni discutimos las noticias del día, ni tomamos un café juntos.
Ahora él no busca razones para venir a mi oficina.

Son las doce. Ahora él prepara las facturas y los depósitos para la
semana. Almuerza rápidamente para volver a su computadora. Casi no
descansa. Todos los empleados salen a las cinco, pero él siempre trabaja
hasta las seis. Tengo mucho que hacer en la casa, pero si hago un gran
esfuerzo, puedo terminar antes de las cinco. Al fin y al cabo, no voy a
llamar a la oficina; es mejor ir a saludar a mis colegas.

# The Indirect Object

## Gustar and the Indirect Object

**Gustar** means _to be pleasing to_ and is used to express the idea of _liking_ in
Spanish.

## Me gusta and me gustan

**Me** is the indirect object pronoun that means _to me_. In Spanish, there is no
exact translation of _I like_. Compare the English construction with the
Spanish construction.

##### Singular Noun as the Subject

**Esta clase** is a singular noun—the subject.

**Gusta** is the verb and agrees with the singular subject.

**Me** is the indirect object pronoun—the person to whom the action is
occurring.


NOTE: In the Spanish construction, subjects retain their articles ( **el, la, los,
las** ) even when the English translation doesn’t include them (for exam-ple,
**el chocolate** , English _Chocolate_ —not _The chocolate—_ in the example
above).

```
A Word About Practicing Orally
```
```
It is essential to practice orally me gusta and all the forms to follow.
The more you practice, the more natural it becomes.
```
##### Plural Noun as the Subject

If the subject of the sentence is a plural noun, **gusta** becomes **gustan** to
agree with the plural subject.

**Los libros** is the plural noun—the subject.

**Gustan** is the verb and agrees with the plural subject.

**Me** is the indirect object pronoun—the person to whom the action is
occurring.

##### Verb as the Subject


**Me gusta** is also used when the subject is a verb. The verb form is the
infinitive, no matter what the English translation is. When an infinitive is
the subject, the singular **gusta** is used.

NOTE: **Gusta** remains singular even if it is followed by a series of verbs.

The only forms of **gustar** that you will need are the third-person singular,
**gusta** , and the third-person plural, **gustan**.

```
To make a sentence negative, simply place no before the indirect object.
```
```
Review
```
- If the subject of the sentence is a singular noun or a verb, use
    **gusta**.
**Me gusta el hotel.
Me gusta viajar.**
- If the subject is a plural noun, use **gustan**.
    **Me gustan las vacaciones.**
- If the sentence is negative, place **no** before the indirect object.
    **No me gustan los ratones.**

#### Te gusta and te gustan


**Te** is the indirect object pronoun that means _to you_. When you use **te** , you
are speaking in the familiar **tú** form.

#### Le gusta and le gustan

**Le** is the indirect object pronoun that means _to him_ ( **a él** ), _to her_ ( **a ella** ),
or _to you_ ( **a Ud.** ).

Because **le** means _to him, to her_ , and _to you_ , it can have any of the
following meanings.


```
The wine is pleasing to him.
The wine is pleasing to her.
The wine is pleasing to you.
```
To clarify this ambiguity, the sentence must begin with a prepositional
phrase that clarifies the meaning of the indirect object pronoun **le**.

You can also insert proper names and nouns in the prepositional phrase.

Singular nouns can be inserted in the prepositional phrases.

#### Nos gusta and nos gustan

**Nos** is the indirect object pronoun that means _to us_.


#### Les gusta and les gustan

**Les** is the indirect object pronoun that means _to them_ ( **a ellos, a ellas** ) and
_to you_ ( **a Uds.** ).

Because **les** means both _to them_ and _to you_ , the meaning of this sentence
can be either of the following.

```
The film is pleasing to them.
The film is pleasing to you (pl.).
```
To clarify this ambiguity, the sentence must begin with a prepositional
phrase that clarifies the meaning of **les**.

Nouns and proper names can be inserted in the prepositional phrases.


If you want to add emphasis to the constructions of **me gusta** and **te gusta** ,
add **a mí** , which emphasizes **me** , and **a ti** , which emphasizes **te**.

There is no ambiguity in these examples. **A mí** and **a ti** give the feeling of
the emphasized pronoun in English: **_I_** _like coffee_. **_You_** _like wine_.

#### Exercise 10.1

_Pronounce the examples aloud so you can become familiar with the sound_.

#### Exercise 10.2

_Complete the following sentences. Choose the correct indirect object
pronoun, as indicated by the prepositional phrase in parentheses, then_


```
choose either gusta or gustan , depending on whether the subject is
singular or plural.
```
1. (A mí) ___________________ el café con azúcar.
2. (A ella) ___________________ el café negro.
3. (A María) ___________________ el té.
4. (A mí) ___________________ escribir libros.
5. (A mis amigos) ___________________ cocinar.

22. ¿(A Uds.) ___________________ el alcalde de su ciudad?


### Verbs like gustar

You have just learned a very important form, not only to express the idea
of _I like_ , but for other verbs as well. The following verbs are used with an
indirect object.

**agradar** _to be pleasing to_ (very close in meaning to **gustar** )

**convenir** _to suit someone, to be convenient (for)_

**doler** _to be painful, to hurt_

```
NOTE: In Spanish, the possessive adjective is not used with parts of the
body and the indirect object pronoun.
```
**encantar** _to be enchanting to, to like very much_

```
NOTE: Encantar is much stronger than gustar. Encantar cannot be used
in the negative.
```
**faltar** _to be lacking_ (something), _to be missing_ (something)


NOTE: **Faltar** can be used without the indirect object pronoun.


#### Exercise 10.3

_Complete the following sentences with the correct prepositional phrase,
according to the words in parentheses_.

1. ________________ le gusta el tenis. ( _to her_ )

4. Yo sé que ________________ te gusta estudiar, pero
    ________________ les gusta ir a fiestas. ( _to you/to them_ )
5. Parece que ________________ le gusta cocinar. ( _to no one_ )
6. ¿ ________________ le gusta limpiar su apartamento? ( _to whom_ )

#### Exercise 10.4

_Change the following singular sentences to plural. Make sure both the
subject and the verb are plural. The indirect object pronoun will remain
the same_.

1. Les encanta ese carro rojo. _________________
2. Te agrada el programa. _________________
3. Me gusta la silla. _________________
4. Nos importa nuestro amigo. _________________

4. ¿Por qué a Uds. les fascina hablar español?

#### The Indirect Object Pronoun

```
Review the indirect object pronouns.
```

So far, you have learned the indirect object with verbs like **gustar**. Now
make sure you know what an indirect object is in other sentences as well.
For example, _I give the gift_ **_to him_**. In this sentence, _to him_ is the indirect
object.
The indirect object receives the action of the verb indirectly. It answers
questions about to whom or for whom an action is done.
In order to have an indirect object in a sentence, there must be a direct
object, either real or implied. In the example above, _the gift_ is the direct
object.

The translation of the indirect object is _to me, to you, to him, to her, to
us, to them_.

```
A Word About Indirect Objects
```
```
Be sure to practice the indirect object orally as much as you can. The
structure of Spanish and English is quite different here, so take your
time and practice.
```
Verbs that commonly take indirect objects follow.



#### Position of the Indirect Object Pronoun

The indirect object pronoun can be placed in either of two positions in a
sentence or phrase.

##### Indirect Object Pronoun Placed Directly Before the First

##### Verb

In the first position, the indirect object pronoun is placed _directly before
the first verb_ in a sentence or question.

Remember that the indirect object pronoun **le** is ambiguous. It means _to
him, to her, to you_. Out of context, there is no way to know what the
meaning is. So a prepositional phrase is added to clarify the meaning.

Remember also that a proper noun can be inserted in the clarifying
prepositional phrase.

A noun can also be inserted in the prepositional phrase.


Like **le, les** is ambiguous. It means t _o you_ ( **a Uds.** ) and _to them_ ( **a ellos, a
ellas** ). A prepositional phrase is added to clarify the meaning. A proper
noun or a noun can also be used as a clarifier.

With the verbs **comprar** and **hacer** , the translation of the indirect object
pronoun is _for me, for you, for him, for her, for us, for them_.

#### Exercise 10.7

_Using the new verbs, complete the following sentences with the correct
verb and indirect object pronoun. Add clarifiers when necessary_.

1. Julia _______________ dos tarjetas cada semana. ( _to write/to me_ )
2. José y Maria _______________ tarjetas desde Barcelona. ( _to write/to_
    _us_ )


3. Carlos _______________ la lección de hoy. ( _to give/to me_ )
4. Yo _______________ si mi tarea está en tu casa. ( _to ask/you_ )
5. Él _______________ que su hermana vive en Nueva York. ( _to say/to_
    _me_ )
6. Ella _______________ su bolígrafo. ( _to lend/to him_ )
7. Nosotros _______________ a hablar español. ( _to teach/to Ana y José_ )
8. Ellos _______________ café con leche a mi oficina. ( _to bring/to us_ )
9. Yo _______________ los resultados de la elección. ( _to tell/to him_ )
10. Yo _______________ , “¿Cuánto _______________ Ud.?” ( _to ask/the
cab driver, to charge/me_ )

#### Exercise 10.8

```
Complete the following sentences with the correct verb and indirect object
pronoun. Notice that these sentences include two verbs. Practice placing
the indirect object pronoun directly before the first verb.
```
1. Alicia _______________ una alfombra. ( _to want to give/to me_ )
2. El maestro _______________ el francés. ( _to want to teach/to his_
    _students_ )
3. Mis primos _______________ un carro para mi cumpleaños. ( _to be_
    _going to buy/for me_ )
4. Yo _______________ mi computadora vieja. ( _to want to sell/to you_ )
5. ¿Tienes frío? Yo _______________ una chaqueta. ( _to be able to_
    _bring/to you_ )
6. Ud. _______________ la verdad. ( _ought to tell/him_ )
7. ¿Quién _______________ las lecciones de hoy? ( _to be able to_
    _teach/us_ )


8. ¿ _______________ Ud. el favor de limpiar mi casa? ( _to be able to_
    _do/for me_ )
9. Yo _______________ buenas direcciones, pero no sé donde estoy. ( _to_
    _want to give/to you_ )
10. Ellos siempre _______________ cómo estoy. ( _to ask/me_ )

##### Indirect Object Pronoun Attached to the Infinitive

```
In the second position, the indirect object pronoun is attached to the
infinitive if there is an infinitive in the sentence or question.
Let us say, for example, that a sentence includes a phrase that has an
infinitive but no other form of a verb. In that type of phrase, any indirect
object pronoun must be attached to the infinitive.
```
```
In other cases, sentences may include a phrase with more than one verb,
one of which is an infinitive. You may also attach an indirect object
pronoun to the infinitive in this type of phrase.
```
#### Exercise 10.9

```
Complete the following sentences by attaching the indirect object pronoun
to the infinitive. Use the words within parentheses as well as the
```

_prepositional phrases in the sentences for clarification_.

1. Ella _______________ un cuento esta noche. ( _to want to tell/to me_ )
2. Patricia _______________ a Ud. su guitarra. ( _to be going to lend_ )
3. ¿Quién _______________ a su familia? ( _to be going to write_ )
4. Nosotros _______________ a sus amigos la casa. ( _to be going to sell_ )
5. Yo _______________ a Uds. mi bicicleta. ( _to want to lend_ )

#### Exercise 10.10

_Some of the following sentences have two verbs; some have one. Complete
the sentences with the correct verb or verbs and indirect object pronoun.
The verbs in this lesson are very important, so try to memorize them as you
do the following exercise_.

1. Si tienes frío, yo _______________ un suéter. ( _to give/to you_ )
2. El camarero _______________ al hombre un vaso de agua. ( _to_
    _bring/to him_ )
3. Manuel _______________ a cocinar. ( _to want to teach/to us_ )
4. Nosotros _______________ el viernes. ( _to be going to write/to them_ )
5. Tú _______________ tus libros todo el tiempo. ( _to lend/to me_ )

```
Review the positions of the indirect object pronoun.
```
- Directly before the first verb
- Attached to the infinitive

Whether the indirect object pronoun is placed directly before the first verb
or is attached to the infinitive, the meaning is exactly the same. Practice
the indirect object pronouns and the verbs aloud as much as you can.

##### Ir de compras

```
A mi amigo Julio y a mí nos gusta ir de compras. Nos fascina pasear en el
carro a regiones en las afueras. Durante el día, nos encanta probar la
comida típica del área. Al entrar en un restaurante, el camarero nos dice
“¿En qué puedo servirles?” y le preguntamos, “¿qué clase de comida nos
recomienda?” Él nos recomienda los mariscos y nos da unos minutos para
decidir. Después de un rato, nos dice, “Disculpe, están Uds. listos para
ordenar?” Julio le pregunta cuánto cuesta la langosta. “No hay” nos
contesta. Escogemos, pues, crema de almejas, cangrejo con ajo y
camarones. Después de la comida deliciosa, continuamos alegremente

#### Reading Comprehension

##### El viaje

Me gusta viajar porque cuando viajo no soy de aquí ni soy de allá. Me
fascina la idea. Pienso ir a Italia. Me dicen que es un país maravilloso, el
más bello del mundo. Me cuentan que la gente es muy amable y que gozan
de la vida cada día. Me dicen que exactamente a las siete todas las noches
en todas las ciudades y todos los pueblos, la gente sale, los jóvenes y los
viejos, salen de sus casas y dan una vuelta por la ciudad. Después de
caminar por una hora, vuelven a la casa para cenar. ¡Qué imagen más
hermosa! Me parece que me va a gustar Italia.

No me importa que hay mucho que hacer antes de viajar. Primero, tengo
que hacer las reservaciones. Voy a pedir un asiento con ventanilla porque
me encanta mirar el cielo y las nubes por la ventana. Yo sé que a otras
personas les gusta el asiento en el pasillo para poder andar por el avión sin
molestar a nadie.
La parte que me encanta más es la hora de la comida. La azafata nos
pregunta, “¿qué quieren Uds.?” Le contestamos con “pollo, por favor,” o
“pescado,” o “prefiero carne, por favor.” Nos dan lo que pedimos y por un
rato hay silencio en el avión mientras los pasajeros comen. Si es largo el
viaje, nos muestran una película y también podemos escuchar música con
los audífonos que nos dan. Yo misma prefiero leer o escribir pero a
muchos viajeros les gusta mirar la película mientras otros duermen.

No puedo tardar más. Primero, voy a escoger una buena fecha que me
va a traer suerte. Después voy a comprar un tiquete de ida y vuelta y un
vuelo directo. Finalmente, voy a arreglar solamente una maleta para no
cargar mucho. Yo sé que una buena experiencia me espera.

# The Direct Object

## The Personal a and the Direct Object

The direct object receives the action of the verb directly.

```
The direct object can be a thing.
```
```
I see the tree.
```
The direct object can be a person.

```
I see the woman.
```
When the direct object is a person, an untranslated **a** is placed directly
before the direct object person. This is called the _personal_ **_a_**.

If the direct object person is masculine and singular, the **a** combines with
**el** and becomes **al**.


Personal **a** is used before **alguien** and **nadie**.

Personal **a** is not used with **tener**.

```
Remember that if the direct object is a thing , there is no personal a.
```
#### Transitive Verbs

Transitive verbs are verbs that take a direct object.
The English translation for many Spanish verbs includes a preposition.
That means that for this type of verb, the direct object will immediately
follow the verb in Spanish, but it will follow a preposition in English.
Look closely at the headings for verbs such as **buscar** _to look_ **_for_**. Study
the following examples.

Here is a list of frequently used transitive verbs.


```
Conocer means to know a person or place in terms of being
acquainted.
```
Compare this with **saber** , which means to know a fact or to know how to
do something.


```
Dejar means to leave something or someone behind.
```
```
Compare that with salir , which means to exit.
```
NOTE: **Encontrar** and **hallar** are synonyms and can be used
interchangeably.


NOTE: **Hallar** and **encontrar** are synonyms and can be used
interchangeably.


```
Querer a una persona means to love a person. This verb is less
strong than amar.
```
Compare that with **amar** , which expresses a deeper love.


#### Exercise 11.1

```
Complete the following sentences, using the correct form of the verb and
the personal a.
```
1. Antes de salir de la casa, ella ___________________. ( _to kiss her_
    _husband_ )
2. Carlos quiere ___________________ el día del amor y la amistad. ( _to_
    _call his friends_ )
3. Yo siempre ___________________ a la tienda. ( _to accompany my_
    _grandmother_ )
4. No puedo ___________________. No sé donde está. ( _to find my_
    _younger brother_ )
5. El estudiante del primer año ___________________. ( _to miss his_
    _family_ )
6. En clase, nosotros ___________________ , y prestamos atención. ( _to_
    _look at the teacher_ )
7. María y Sofía quieren ___________________ en el hospital. ( _to help_
    _the patients_ )
8. Yo ___________________ well. ( _to know Peter_ )
9. Los profesores ___________________ cada día en el colegio. ( _to see_
    _their students_ )
10. Los padres ____________________. ( _to take care of their children_ )
11. El taxista ___________________ al hotel. ( _to take the tourists_ )
12. Ella no entiende la lección porque no ___________________. ( _to
listen to the teacher_ )
13. Jorge no puede ___________________ y está preocupado. ( _to find his
sister_ )
14. No sé porque él ___________________. ( _to yell at his boss_ )


15. Roberto va a ___________________ a la fiesta. ( _to invite Ramona_ )
16. Veinte minutos pasan y Teresa no quiere ___________________ más.
    ( _to wait for her friend_ )

### The Direct Object Pronoun

The direct object pronouns me, te, nos , and os have the same form as the
indirect object pronouns me, te, nos , and os. The only new forms are lo,
los, la , and las.

```
Make sure you know what the direct objects and direct object pronouns are
in all cases. Review the following.
```
```
I see the man.
```
```
In this sentence, the man is the direct object.
I see the tree.
```
```
In this sentence, the tree is the direct object.
```
```
The direct object pronoun replaces the direct object.
```
```
I see the man. I see him.
I see the tree. I see it.
```
```
Review what you know about direct object pronouns.
```
- The direct object pronoun replaces the direct object.
- The direct object pronoun can refer to a person or a thing.
- It receives the action of the verb directly.
- It answers the question about what or who received the action.


#### Position of the Direct Object Pronoun

The direct object pronoun can be placed in either of two positions in a
sentence or phrase.

##### Direct Object Pronoun Placed Directly Before the First Verb

In the first position, the direct object pronoun is placed _directly before the
first verb_ in a sentence or question.

##### Direct Object Pronoun Attached to the Infinitive

In the second position, the direct object pronoun is attached to the
infinitive. Whether the direct object pronoun is placed before the first verb
or attached to the infinitive, the meaning of the sentence is the same.

#### The Direct Object Pronoun as a Person

The direct object pronoun needs no clarifiers, since it is clear that **lo** can
only mean _him_ , **la** can only mean _her_ , **los** can only mean _them_ (masculine,
or masculine and feminine), and **las** can only mean _them_ (feminine).


In order to express the direct object pronoun _you_ in the **Ud.** and **Uds.** form,
the indirect object pronoun **le** and **les** is used in most countries.

To make a sentence negative, place **no** before the direct object pronoun.

When the direct object pronoun is attached to the infinitive, place **no**
before the first verb.

#### Exercise 11.2

_Complete the following sentences with the correct form of the verb and the
direct object pronoun_.

¡Es increíble! Aquí estoy en Italia. Hay muchos italianos en el aeropuerto
que esperan a los pasajeros. Yo los miro: un hombre besa a una mujer; tres
niños corren hacia una mujer y emocionados la besan, y ella, con lágrimas
en los ojos, los besa y los abraza. Una mujer le dice a su novio que lo
extraña cuando está lejos de ella; él le dice que la ama. Los niños, tan
contentos de ver a sus padres de nuevo, saltan de alegría. Los viajeros
como yo, sin familia (nadie nos espera porque no conocemos a nadie),
recogemos nuestras maletas y seguimos a la aduana. No me molesta
esperar un rato. Dentro de poco, sellan mi pasaporte y me dan una
bienvenida cariñosa.
Salgo del aeropuerto al sol. Camino hacia los taxistas. Hace fresco y
estoy bien. Tomo el primer taxi en la fila, le pregunto al conductor cuanto
cobra por el viaje y me parece justo. Me lleva a la plaza central donde hay

muchos hoteles interesantes. Pago la tarifa, le doy una propina, y con una
sonrisa, me bajo del taxi.

Entro en el hotel que me interesa y le pregunto al dueño cuanto cobra
por una noche para una persona. Le digo que quiero una habitación
sencilla y tranquila con un baño privado. El dueño, muy simpático, me
dice que tiene una habitación hermosa que da a la plaza. Después de verla,
la tomo. Él mira mi pasaporte. Escribo mi nombre en el registro, y él me
da las llaves. Estoy cansada pero estoy emocionada también. Ya es tarde.
Decido comer un pasaboca e ir al cuarto para dormir. Yo sé que voy a tener

# Reflexive Verbs

A verb is reflexive when the subject and the object refer to the same
person. The purpose of the reflexive verb is to show that the action of the
verb remains with the subject. This can be seen in the following sentence.

## The Reflexive Pronouns

The reflexive pronouns are object pronouns.

In Spanish reflexive verbs, **-se** is added to the basic infinitive.

To conjugate a reflexive verb, drop the **-se** and place the reflexive
pronoun before the conjugated verb. The reflexive verb always has a
reflexive pronoun.


Compare the reflexive verb with the nonreflexive verb.

### Some Frequently Used Reflexive Verbs



```
A Word About Reflexive Verbs
```
```
It is not necessary to use both the subject pronoun and the reflexive
pronoun with reflexive verbs, except in the third person for clarity.
From now on, the subject pronouns yo, tú, nosotros , and vosotros
will be omitted. Practice reflexive verbs aloud with their reflexive
pronouns.
```
### Reflexive Verbs Whose English

### Translations Do Not Necessarily Include

### Oneself


### Position of the Reflexive Pronoun

The reflexive pronoun can be placed in either of two positions in a
sentence or phrase.

In the first position, the reflexive pronoun is placed directly before the
conjugated verb.

#### Review Chart of Indirect and Direct Object

#### Pronouns and Reflexive Pronouns


### Reflexive Verbs with Reciprocal Meanings

The plural forms of reflexive verbs are sometimes used to express the idea
of _each other_. If the meaning is unclear, Spanish uses **el uno al otro, la
una a la otra, los unos a los otros** , and **las unas a las otras** for
clarification.


### Se and Impersonal Expressions

In impersonal expressions with **se** , the verb has no personal subject. In
English these sentences are translated by subjects such as _one, you, they,
people_ (in general), or by the passive voice.
The third-person singular or plural of the verb is used in these
expressions.

##### El encuentro

Me despierto bien. Me gustan las cortinas delgadas porque dejan entrar la
luz de la mañana. Más allá de mi ventana, veo las plantas exuberantes de
verde radiante. Después de ducharme largamente, me pongo un vestido
sencillo pero elegante y salgo del hotel con el libro de turismo en mi
bolsa. Busco un restaurante acogedor para tomar el primer café del día.
Entro en uno que tiene un ambiente agradable y miro todos los pasteles.
No puedo escoger entre el de nata y la torta con crema y fruta; pues, pido


dos pasteles y un café solo, y me los da. Me siento en una mesa hermosa
para dos.

El café está fuerte y delicioso. No hay razón para apresurarme y como
los pasteles tranquilamente. El restaurante se llena; se ve que la gente es
muy amable y habladora. Conversan con todo el cuerpo, sobre todo con las
manos. ¿De qué hablan, tan animados, a esta hora tan temprano de la
mañana?
No conozco a nadie. Pero me parece posible encontrarme a alguien, a
una persona con quien pueda tener una conversación interesante. (Este
restaurante es un buen sitio; no me muevo de aquí por un rato.) Alguien va
a verme, aquí sentada, y en vez de pasar por mi mesa sin decir nada, me va
a decir; “Señorita, está ocupada esta silla?” Yo le voy a contestar con una
sonrisa, “No, Ud. puede sentarse.” Y él se sienta complacido. Dentro de
poco somos amigos, y después de tomar otro café y otro pastel, él me
invita a acompañarlo a un museo y tomar un vino con él. Charlamos y nos
reímos y nos divertimos mucho durante nuestra cena de pescado y
camarones. A lo lejos, en la distancia, lo veo venir.

# The Present Subjunctive

The present subjunctive is a mood in the present tense, widely used in
Spanish but rarely used in English. So far you have studied the present
tense in the indicative mood, the most frequently used mood in the
language. This chapter introduces the present subjunctive. It is important
to learn it now so that you can express yourself confidently and freely in
the present tense.

The present subjunctive cannot exist alone. Another element in the
sentence always causes it to be used. The subjunctive is often needed after
the following elements.

- Certain impersonal expressions
- Certain verbs
- Certain conjunctions
- Certain dependent adjective clauses
- Certain expressions

## Formation of the Present Subjunctive

- Almost all verbs form the present subjunctive from the first-person
    singular **yo** form of the present indicative. Drop the **-o** to get the stem
    for the present subjunctive.


- Verbs that are irregular in the present indicative are irregular in the
    present subjunctive in the same way.
- There are only six verbs that do not form the present subjunctive from
    the **yo** form of the present indicative.

#### -Ar Verbs

In order to conjugate both regular and irregular **-ar** verbs in the present
subjunctive, you start with the **yo** form of the present indicative. Drop the
**-o** and add **-e, -es, -e, -emos, -éis, -en** to the stem.

Note that the first-person singular and the third-personal singular are
identical in the present subjunctive.


The first two examples, **cantar** and **bailar** , are regular. The last three,
**cerrar, pensar** , and **recordar** , are irregular in the present indicative. Note
that their stem changes in the present indicative are also present in the
present subjunctive, except in the **nosotros** and **vosotros** forms, which are
unaffected by stem changes.

```
A Word About the Present Subjunctive
```
```
The formation of the subjunctive comes from the conjugation of the
first-person singular of the present indicative. Any irregularity that
the verb has in the present indicative yo form also occurs in the
present subjunctive. To learn the subjunctive well, practice the yo
form of the verbs, because that will be the stem of the present
subjunctive.
```
#### -Er and -ir Verbs

In order to conjugate both regular and irregular **-er** and **-ir** verbs in the
present subjunctive, you drop the **-o** from the first-person singular of the
present indicative and add **-a, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, -an** to the stem.

##### -Er Verbs


##### -Ir Verbs


NOTE: In the irregular **-ir** verbs, there is an additional irregularity in the
**nosotros** and **vosotros** forms. The stem change **e. ie** or **e. i** has an **-i-** in the
**nosotros** and **vosotros** forms. The stem change **o. ue** has a **-u-** in the
**nosotros** and **vosotros** forms.

##### -Er and -ir Verbs with -g- or -zc- in the yo Form

In the present subjunctive, certain **-er** and **-ir** verbs carry the irregularity
of the first-person singular throughout the conjugation. There are no **-ar**
verbs that have this irregularity.



#### Irregular Verbs

There are only six verbs that have a present subjunctive that is not formed
from the first-person singular. They are irregular in that they cannot be
formed from the **yo** form.

NOTES: **Dé** (the form for both the first- and third-person singular of **dar** )
has a written accent to distinguish it from **de** ( _of_ ).


The word **hay** comes from the infinitive **haber**. You will not need this
form for any other use at this time.

#### Verbs with Orthographic Changes

Verbs with orthographic changes are not irregular. The spelling changes
simply maintain the sound of the **yo** form. Some of the most common
spelling changes are the following.

- Verbs that end in **-gar** change **g** to **gu**.
- Verbs that end in **-car** change **c** to **qu**.
- Verbs that end in **-zar** change **z** to **c**.


NOTE: The change **z. c** occurs before the vowel **e** without affecting the
sound. The consonants **c** (before **i** and **e** ), **s** , and **z** all have the same sound.

```
A Word About Pronunciation of the Present Subjunctive
```
```
Like the present indicative, the stress in the present subjunctive tense
is on the second to last syllable. As you practice, make sure you
```

```
pronounce the verbs in this way: yo cante, tú cantes, él cante,
nosotros cantemos, ellos canten. If a word carries an accent mark,
stress the accented syllable: vosotros cantéis.
```
### Uses of the Present Subjunctive

Remember that the subjunctive mood cannot exist alone; it must always be
caused by some other element in the sentence. This is a mood that
expresses wishes, doubts, and what is possible, rather than what is certain.
Following are the specific uses of the present subjunctive.

#### After Certain Impersonal Expressions

A sentence or question may consist of a main clause and a dependent or
subordinate clause connected by the Spanish conjunction **que**.
Here is a sentence with a main clause and a subordinate clause in the
indicative mood.

However, suppose that the main clause has an impersonal expression, such
as **Es dudoso**. This causes the subjunctive to be used in the dependent
clause.

Frequently used impersonal expressions are the following.


Once you begin a sentence with one of the impersonal expressions above,
it is mandatory to use the subjunctive in the dependent clause. You do not
have to make any decisions, nor do you have a choice about whether or not
to use it. These impersonal expressions in the main clause always trigger
the subjunctive in the subordinate clause.

Notice that some of the example sentences and questions above are
translated with the future in English. This is because the present
subjunctive carries with it a feeling of the future and doubt.


```
If you wish to make a general statement with an impersonal expression,
you need neither a dependent clause nor a subjunctive. You simply use the
structure you have already learned, which follows English word order.
```

#### After Certain Verbs

#### Expressing Wishes or Preferences

```
Verbs that express wishes or preferences with regard to other people in the
main clause will cause the subjunctive mood in the dependent clause. The
subject in the main clause must be different from the subject in the
dependent clause.
```
```
Here is a sentence with a main clause and a subordinate clause in the
indicative mood.
```
```
However, suppose that the main clause has one of the verbs above, such as
Él quiere. This causes the subjunctive to be used in the dependent clause.
```

The English equivalent does not always show the distinction in moods like
Spanish does. But even in the English translation of the above example, it
is clear that the person in the main clause, _he_ , wants the other person, _me_ ,
to do something.

If there is only one subject for the two verbs in a sentence, there is neither
a dependent clause nor a subjunctive.

##### Expressing Hope, Happiness, Sadness, or Regret

Verbs that express hope, happiness, sadness, or regret with regard to other
people in the main clause will cause the subjunctive mood in the
dependent clause.


If there is only one subject for the two verbs in a sentence, the sentence
follows the basic structure that you have learned.

##### Expressing Orders, Requests, or Advice

Verbs that express orders, requests, or advice in the main clause will cause
the subjunctive mood in the dependent clause.


**Dejar, permitir, prohibir** , and **mandar** can be used in two ways.

**Decir** is used, as you have learned, to relate a fact. This idea is expressed
with the indicative.


However, when **decir** is used to give an _order_ , the subjunctive is used in
the dependent clause.

Notice that when English _to tell_ is being used to order someone to do
something, the command form is always the conjugation of the verb _to tell_
+ the infinitive.

```
An English command is expressed as follows: He tells me to go.
Compare that to simply relating a fact: He tells me that the bus is here.
```
##### Expressing Doubt or Uncertainty

Verbs that express doubt or uncertainty in the main clause will cause the
subjunctive mood in the dependent clause.


#### Exercise 13.2

```
Complete the following sentences with the correct form of the present
subjunctive.
```
1. ¿Qué quieres que yo te ___________________? (decir)
2. Él quiere que su amiga ___________________ la cuenta. (pagar)
3. Espero que Uds. ___________________ bien. (sentirse)
4. Ellos se alegran de que el bebé ___________________. (dejar de
    llorar)
5. Ellos nos piden que ___________________ mejor la idea. (explicar)
6. A él no le gusta que yo siempre ___________________ razón. (tener)
7. Rosa insiste en que su jefe le ___________________ más dinero.
    (dar)
8. No creo que Alicia ___________________ la fecha. (saber)
9. Ellas dudan que ___________________ mucho tráfico hoy. (haber)
10. Les sugiero a sus padres que ___________________ de vacaciones.
(ir)
11. Me alegro de que no ___________________ nada grave. (ser)
12. Los expertos nos aconsejan que ___________________ ejercicio.
(hacer)
13. Paula espera que su hermana ___________________ bien. (estar)
14. Yo dudo que Uds. me ___________________ en la reunión. (ver)

#### Exercise 13.3

```

required. Choose any appropriate verb that causes the subjunctive to be
needed in the dependent clause.
```
```
EXAMPLE A mis padres les gusta viajar. Quiero que ellos viajen.
```

1. Mi amigo tiene malos sueños. ___________________
2. Ella no se divierte mucho. ___________________
3. Nosotros somos buenos estudiantes. ___________________
4. No vamos a volver a los Estados Unidos. ___________________
5. Sara me trae flores a mi casa. ___________________
6. ¿Conoce Ud. a mi tío? [Write a response.] ___________________

9. Espero que ella ___________________ de las instrucciones.
    (acordarse)
10. ¿No crees que aquellas tortas ___________________ deliciosas?
(estar)


#### Exercise 13.5

_Complete the story with the correct form (subjunctive, indicative, or
infinitive) of each verb in parentheses_.
Mariana ___________________ (1. levantarse) temprano porque hoy sus
nietos quieren ___________________ (2. ir) al circo. Ella insiste en que
ellos ___________________ (3. desayunarse) bien antes de
___________________ (4. salir). Ella espera que

___________________ (5. divertirse) mucho porque el circo
___________________ (6. venir) raras veces a su pueblo. Hace frío y ella

les aconseja que ___________________ (7. ponerse) la chaqueta para el
invierno. Ellos están contentos de que su abuela ___________________
(8. ser) tan simpática.

#### After Certain Conjunctions

A subjunctive form follows directly after one of the following
conjunctions if the main clause has a different subject than the dependent
clause.

Here is a sentence in which there is only one subject.

In the following sentence, there are two subjects connected by the
conjunction **que**.


The English equivalent does not show the distinction in moods the way
Spanish does. However, there are clearly two subjects in the example
above: _she_ and _he_.

If there is only one subject in the sentence, an infinitive will follow the
preposition.

Some conjunctions of time always cause a subjunctive, whether there are
two subjects or only one in the sentence. Such conjunctions are the
following.

#### After cuando


The subjunctive form directly follows **cuando** if the future is implied.

When **cuando** introduces a question, the indicative form is used.

When **cuando** introduces a sentence that involves either a repeated action
or a general statement in the present, the indicative mood is used.

#### Exercise 13.6

_Complete the following sentences, using the verbs and conjunctions in
parentheses_.

1. ___________________ ( _after_ ) yo ___________________ ( _to bathe_
    _myself_ ), voy a vestirme.
2. No voy ___________________ ( _unless_ ) Uds. ___________________
    ( _to go_ ) también.


3. Él va a invitar a su amiga a la fiesta ___________________ ( _as soon_

#### In Certain Dependent Adjective Clauses


The subjunctive mood is used in the dependent clause if the object or
person described in the main clause is indefinite or nonexistent. In the
following examples, the objects and persons described in the main clause
are not known.

#### After the Expressions por más que and por mucho

#### que

#### After ojalá

An interjection of Arabic origin, **ojalá** means _would to God that_ or _may
God grant_ and expresses great desire. It can also be translated as _I hope_.

#### After acaso, quizás , and tal vez


#### After aunque

The subjunctive mood is used if the action has not yet occurred.

#### After Compounds of -quiera

#### After como

#### Reading Comprehension


##### La despedida

Esta noche, cuando me acueste, va a ser mi última noche en Italia. Es una
lástima que ya no pueda pasar las mañanas en pura tranquilidad en ese
restaurante acogedor donde tomo mi café.

La soledad es diferente aquí que allí, quizás por el calor humano de los
italianos. Mi amiga Beatriz quiere que me quede. Nos llevamos bien. A
ella le gusta mostrarme lo histórico de las ciudades y la verdad es que me
fascina lo antiguo. Realmente, no me importa mucho adonde vamos, si
vamos a un sitio u otro, porque siempre nos divertimos juntas.

Cuando yo esté en los Estados Unidos (no lo puedo imaginar) quiero
que ella me escriba desde Italia. La voy a extrañar. Pero es el fin de mi
viaje.

A todas las personas con quienes me reúno, les deseo lo mejor y les
agradezco por todo. Voy a despedirme de ellos con un abrazo y mucho
cariño cuando les diga “adiós”.

**_Verbos_**

# Preterit Tense, Imperfect Tense,

# and Double Object Pronouns


# 14

# The Preterit Tense

The preterit expresses an action or actions completed in the past. The
English translation is usually the simple past (for example, _I sang_ ). The
preterit is used to express the following.

- Actions completed in the past
- A series of completed actions in the past
- Conditions no longer in effect

## Formation of the Preterit

Verbs are considered regular if there is no change in the stem. Most verbs
are regular in the preterit. This tense is formed by adding the preterit
endings to the stem of the infinitive of **-ar, -er** , and **-ir** verbs.

There are only 17 basic irregular verbs in the preterit. Compound forms
of these verbs are conjugated in the same way as the main verb.

Some **-ir** verbs have a stem change in the third person of the preterit,
but these verbs are not considered irregular.

## Regular -ar Verbs

In order to conjugate a regular **-ar** verb in the preterit tense, drop the
ending and add **-é, -aste, -ó, -amos, -asteis, -aron** to the stem. All **-ar**
verbs except **andar, dar** , and **estar** are regular in the preterit.


In **-ar** verbs, the first-person plural preterit **nosotros** form is identical to
the present indicative **nosotros** form. Whether a particular verb is in the
present or the past becomes clear in context.

```
A Word About Pronunciation
```
```
Notice that the first- and third-person singular forms carry written
accents. It is very important to practice the pronunciation and to
stress the accented syllable. Pronounce the verbs in this way: yo
canté, tú cantaste, el cantó, nosotros cantamos, vosotros
cantasteis, ellos cantaron. Review the basic pronunciation rules: All
words that end in n, s , or any vowel have the stress on the second to
last, or penultimate, syllable.
```
#### Regular -er and -ir Verbs

In order to conjugate regular **-er** and **-ir** verbs, drop the ending and add **-í,
-iste, -ió, -imos, -isteis, -ieron** to the stem. The endings are the same for
both **-er** and **-ir** verbs.


Notice that the verb **ver** is regular. It does not carry an accent mark on the
third-person singular, **vio** , because the form has only one syllable.

##### -Ir Verbs

In **-ir** verbs, the **nosotros** form of the preterit is identical to the present
indicative **nosotros** form. Its meaning becomes clear in context.

#### Key Vocabulary

These words will help enhance your ability to communicate. As you learn
them, remember to practice them aloud.


#### Exercise 14.1

```
Complete the following sentences with the correct preterit form of the verb
in parentheses.
```
1. Ella ___________________ la puerta. (abrir)
2. Yo ___________________ la ventana. (cerrar)
3. Nosotros ___________________ a México hace ocho meses. (viajar)
4. Anoche, el niño ___________________ televisión por dos horas.
    (mirar)

    (divertirse)
14. Ella le ___________________ al hombre un vaso de agua. (ofrecer)
15. Ellos me ___________________ con la pronunciación. (ayudar)

### Uses of the Preterit

```
Always keep in mind that the action or actions expressed by the preterit
are over. It doesn’t make any difference how long the action went on

### Irregular Verbs

It is important to memorize all the irregular verbs. Once you do, you will
be able to use any verb you wish in the preterit.

Irregular verbs in the preterit have an irregular stem and a special set of
endings. Note that the endings do not carry accent marks. In order to
conjugate an irregular verb in the preterit, add the endings **-e, -iste, -o, -
imos, -isteis, -ieron** to the irregular stems.


**Dar, ir** , and **ser** have slightly different endings.


The conjugations for **ir** and **ser** are identical in the preterit. The meaning
is clarified in context, as in the following examples.

**Haber** is used to express English _there was, there were, was there?, were
there?_ The third-person singular preterit form **hubo** is used with both
singular and plural subjects.

Note the following about the irregular preterit verbs above.

- **Hizo** (the third-person singular of **hacer** ) shows the spelling change **c** >
    **z** to maintain the sound of /s/.
- Irregular preterits whose stem ends in **j** have **-eron** , not **-ieron** , in the
    third-person plural, for example, **dijeron, trajeron**.

Compound forms of verbs are conjugated in the same way as the main
verb.


Here are some examples of irregular verbs in the preterit.

#### -Ir Verbs with Stem Changes in the Third Person


**-Ir** verbs that are irregular in the present indicative have a stem change in
the preterit. This stem change occurs only in the third-person singular and
plural forms of the preterit.

**e** > **ie** in the present indicative

**e** > **i** in the preterit

**e** > **i** in the present indicative

**e** > **i** in the preterit


**o** > **ue** in the present indicative


```
o > u in the preterit

    Uds.? (sentirse/sentirse)

### Verbs with Orthographic Changes

#### -Ar Verbs

```
Verbs with orthographic changes are not irregular. The spelling changes
simply maintain the necessary sound. Only verbs in the yo form are
affected by the spelling changes in the preterit of -ar verbs.
```
- Verbs that end in **-gar** change **g** to **gu**.
- Verbs that end in **-car** change **c** to **qu**.
- Verbs that end in **-zar** change **z** to **c**.


Note that the spelling change **z**. **c** occurs before the vowel **e** without
affecting the sound, as in **comenzar, comencé**.

```
A Word About Pronunciation
```
```
Make sure to stress the final sound of the first-person singular ( yo
form) and the third-person singular ( él, ella, Ud. form). Spanish
pronunciation is precise, and the tense you use depends on the correct
pronunciation. So continue to practice in this way: yo apagué, tú
apagaste, él apagó, nosotros apagamos, vosotros apagasteis, ellos
apagaron.
```
Here are more **-ar** verbs with spelling changes.



#### Exercise 14.8

_Complete the following sentences with the correct form of the preterit_.

1. Me desperté con vértigo y ___________________ con la pared.
    (tropezarse)
2. Hace una semana, Laura pagó la cuenta, pero ayer yo la
    ___________________. (pagar)
3. El estudiante orgulloso le ___________________ su tarea a la
    profesora. (entregar)
4. Nosotros ___________________ de un lado a otro el año pasado.
    (vagar)
5. Anoche, yo ___________________ una pintura en la pared. (colgar)
6. Su papá se enojó anteayer y ___________________ a sus hijos.
    (castigar)

#### -Er and -ir Verbs

Verbs with spelling changes are not irregular. The spelling changes shown
for **-er** and **-ir** verbs with stems ending in a vowel avoid the use of three
vowels in a row.

Verbs with a vowel immediately preceding the infinitive ending change
**i** to **y** in the third-person singular and plural. In these verbs, there is a
written accent over the letter **i** on the **yo, tú, nosotros** , and **vosotros**
endings.


Note, for example, that the third-person singular of **caer** is **cayó** rather
than **caió**.

Verbs that end in **-uir** change **i** to **y** ; the accent over the **i** appears only
over the first-person singular.

Here are more **-er** and **-ir** verbs with spelling changes.

#### Exercise 14.9


_Complete the following sentences with the correct preterit form of the verb
in parentheses_.

### Verbs with Special Meanings in the

### Preterit


```
A Word About Translations
```
```
The preterit expresses an action completed in the past. These
translations are as close as possible to transmitting the idea of the
sentence. No querer means not to want. But in the preterit, the action
is over, so the concept is stronger than she didn’t want to go down in
the elevator. She didn’t want to, and she didn’t; therefore, she
refused. Similarly, no poder means not to be able. But in the preterit,
the people were not able to leave, and the action is completed;
therefore, they didn’t manage to leave, or failed to leave.
```
#### Exercise 14.11

Complete the following sentences with the correct form of the preterit.
```
1. Yo ___________________ en el apartamento a las ocho anoche.

ACUSADO Tengo setenta años y es la primera vez que me ven en la corte.
¿Cuál es la primera acusación contra mí?
ACUSADOR Ud. es culpable de investigar bajo la tierra y en el cielo y de
enseñarles a otros las mismas cosas.
ACUSADO No tengo nada que ver con estas acusaciones y nada de esto es
verdad.
ACUSADOR Pero, ¿cuál es el problema, entonces? ¿Por qué hay tantos
prejuicios contra Ud. si dice que no hace nada diferente de los demás?
```

Nos puede decir Ud. lo que es, para que le demos un veredicto justo.
ACUSADO Bueno. Voy a decirles toda la verdad. Me dan esta reputación por
cierta sabiduría que tengo. Menciono el dios de Delfos para que él sea
mi testigo. ¿Se acuerdan Uds. de Querefón? Él fue al dios de Delfos y
le preguntó si hay una persona más sabia que yo. El dios contestó que
no hay nadie. Pero, ¿qué significa la idea de que yo soy el hombre más
sagaz de todos? Me tocó investigar la cuestión. Yo fui a ver a un
hombre que tiene la reputación de ser sagaz. Lo examiné. No es
necesario que les diga su nombre, él es un político, y esto es el
resultado.

# The Imperfect Tense

The imperfect tense expresses an action or actions in the past that are not
seen as completed. The imperfect is used in the following ways.

- To “set the stage” in the past; to express a narration, situation, or
    background in the past
- To express habitual, customary, or repeated actions in the past
- To express continuous actions or actions in progress in the past
- To express a description in the past
- To express point of origin in the past
- To express time in the past
- To express one’s age in the past

## Formation of the Imperfect

Almost all verbs are regular in the imperfect tense. The tense is formed by
adding the imperfect endings to the stem of the **-ar, -er** , and **-ir** verbs.
There are only three irregular verbs in the imperfect.

## Regular -ar Verbs

To conjugate an - **ar** verb in the imperfect tense, drop the ending and add **-
aba, -abas, -aba, -ábamos, -abais, -aban** to the stem. Note that the first-


and third-person singular forms ( **yo, él** / **ella** / **Ud.** ) are identical in the
imperfect. There are no irregular **-ar** verbs.


**A Word About the Imperfect**

```
Practice the pronunciation of the imperfect -ar verbs. There are one-
syllable, two-syllable, three-syllable, and four-syllable verbs. Be sure
to pronounce the imperfect in this way: yo trabajaba, tú trabajabas,
```

```
él trabajaba, nosotros trabajábamos, vosotros trabajabais, ellos
trabajaban.
```
#### Regular -er and -ir Verbs

To conjugate regular **-er** and **-ir** verbs in the imperfect, drop the ending
and add **-ía, -ías, -ía, -íamos, -íais, -ían** to the stem. The endings are the
same for both **-er** and **-ir** verbs.

##### -Er Verbs

**Haber** is used to express English _there was, there were, was there?, were
there?_ The third-person singular imperfect form **había** is used with both
singular and plural subjects.

##### -Ir Verbs


#### Irregular Verbs

```
The translation of ir in the imperfect is was going, were going.
```
### Uses of the Imperfect

The imperfect tense expresses actions in the past that are not seen as
completed. It is used to indicate situations or actions in the past with no
specific reference to their beginning or end.


#### To “Set the Stage” in the Past; to Express a

#### Narration, Situation, or Background

#### To Express Habitual, Customary, or Repeated

#### Actions in the Past

```
A Word About the Translations
```
```
Read the example sentences again, and try to understand the concepts
without the translations. Try to imagine these examples as scenes:
they are situations, narrations in the past; they are backgrounds; they
“set the stage.” The English translations are not precise or consistent
in the imperfect. Make sure you understand this important concept
and choose whichever translation or idea is clearest for you.
```

#### To Express Continuous Actions in the Past

Note that in the last three example sentences above, both the imperfect and
the preterit tenses are used. The first part of the sentence is the ongoing
action, the action in progress. The second part of the sentence, which
requires the preterit, is a completed action. Here, the imperfect is used as a
continuous action that is interrupted by another action.

#### To Express a Description in the Past

#### To Express Point of Origin in the Past


#### To Express Time in the Past

#### To Express One’s Age in the Past

#### Exercise 15.1

_Complete the following sentences with the correct form of the imperfect. In
the parentheses, write your reason for choosing the imperfect_.

_______________________________________________________
```
#### Preterit and Imperfect Compared

Compare the differences in meaning between the following sentence pairs
(preterit followed by imperfect).



#### Querer, poder, saber

For the verbs **querer** and **poder** , the English translations of the example
sentences above showing the preterit and the imperfect are the same.


However, the preterit **pudimos** from **poder** indicates that the action is
over. The idea is that we were able to understand the lesson; the action is
completed, so we succeeded in understanding the lesson.

#### Exercise 15.3

1. _It was one o’clock and it was raining_.

#### Double Object Pronouns

```
In Spanish, two object pronouns can appear together with a verb.
```
- Double object pronouns cannot be separated from each other.
- In a negative sentence, the word **no** (or any other word of negation)
    comes directly before the first pronoun.
- Positions of the double object pronouns are the same as single object
    pronouns: The pronouns are placed directly before the first verb _or_ they
    are attached to the infinitive.

#### Indirect Object Pronoun with Direct Object

#### Pronoun

```
An indirect object pronoun precedes a direct object pronoun when they
occur together. In the first position, the object pronouns are placed directly
before the first verb.
```
##### Me lo / me la / me los / me las


In the second position, the object pronouns are attached to the infinitive
and become one word. A written accent is added to maintain the natural
stress of the infinitive. Whether the object pronouns are placed in front of
the first verb or attached to the infinitive, the meaning of the sentence is
the same.

#### Exercise 15.7

_Translate the following sentences into English. Practice the use of the
double object pronouns along with the tenses you have learned: present
indicative, present subjunctive, preterit, and imperfect_.

1. Yo quería tomar un café esta mañana. Mi colega me lo trajo.

##### Se lo / se la / se los / se las

For reasons of pronunciation, **se** replaces the indirect object pronouns **le**
and **les** when they are followed by a direct object pronoun.

Out of context, there is no way to know what the meaning of the indirect
object pronoun is. To clarify the ambiguity, a prepositional phrase is
added.


In context, however, the meaning is clear without an additional
prepositional phrase.

```

objects.

#### Reflexive Pronoun with Direct Object Pronoun

```
This combination does not occur with many verbs. It is most common with
the action of putting on or taking off clothes ( ponerse la ropa, quitarse la
ropa ) , with verbs that are used with parts of the body ( lavarse, cepillarse,
lesionarse, peinarse, secarse ), and with some idiomatic verbs ( comerse ).
A reflexive object pronoun precedes a direct object pronoun when they
occur together.
The objects are either placed directly before the first verb or attached to
the infinitive.
```

**A Reminder**

```
When reflexive verbs are used with clothes and parts of the body, the
possessive adjective is not used.
```

#### Se Plus the Indirect Object Pronoun and

#### Unplanned Occurrences

**Se** + the indirect object pronoun + the verb express the concept of an
action that just seemed to happen—an unplanned occurrence. The indirect
object pronoun indicates the person or persons _responsible for_ or _affected
by_ the action.

This construction occurs only in the third person because the subject is
a thing or things. It usually occurs in the preterit because the action has
already happened.

Here are other verbs that often express this concept.


#### Exercise 15.11

_Complete the following sentences with the correct verb form and object
pronouns_.

ACUSADO Cuando yo hablé con él, me di cuenta de que él no era sabio.
Cuando me fui, pensaba, “Yo soy más sabio que este hombre; ninguno
de nosotros no sabe nada que valga la pena saber, pero él piensa que él
tiene sabiduría cuando él no la tiene, y yo, sin saber nada, no pienso
que yo sea sagaz. No pienso que sé lo que no sé.” Después, fui a ver a
los poetas, pensando que ellos iban a ser más sagaces que yo.
Pero averigüé que no es por la sabiduría que los poetas crean sus
poemas sino por una inspiración divina. Por fin, fui a ver a los

sagaz y si él no es sagaz yo se lo digo. Estoy tan ocupado en mi
investigación que no he tenido tiempo ni para servir en posiciones del

# Ser and Estar and the Present

# Tense

## Estar (to be)

Spanish has two verbs that are equivalent to English _to be_. Begin with the
conjugation of **estar** in the present tense.

There is no subject pronoun _it_ in Spanish. **Él** and **ella** refer to people and
sometimes to animals, but not to things.

Practice the conjugation of the verb aloud. Notice that **él, ella, Ud.** (the
third-person singular) have the same form of the verb. Notice also that
**ellos, ellas, Uds.** (the third-person plural) have the same form of the verb.

**Estar** is used to express four basic concepts: location, health, changing
mood or condition, and personal opinion in terms of taste or appearance.

- **Location** (where someone or something is physically located)


**Remember**

```
The verb, which carries the action of the phrase, is the essential
element of the Spanish sentence or question because of the amount of
information it carries.
```

```
Remember
```
```
Often, the pronouns yo, nosotros , and tú are omitted. This is possible
because the verb form estamos carries the meaning we are ; estoy can
only mean I am. The same is true of tú estás , which means you are
whether tú is omitted or not.
```
#### Key Vocabulary

These words will help enhance your ability to communicate. As you learn
them, remember to practice them aloud.

##### Interrogative Words

##### Adverbs of Location

##### Adverbs of Direction


##### Prepositions of Location

##### Adjectives


NOTE **Guapo** describes people only; **bonito, hermoso** , and **lindo** are used
to describe both people and things.

#### Exercise 16.1

_Complete the following sentences with the correct form of_ **_estar_**_. Indicate
whether the sentence expresses health, location, or changing mood_.

1. El teléfono y el libro ___________________ en la mesa.
    (___________________)
2. La mujer ___________________ bien; el hombre

### Ser (to be)

```
Ser is also equivalent to English to be. In English, there is only a single
verb that means to be. We say, for example:
```
```
The dog is here.
The dog is brown.
```
```
The verb is the same in both cases. But in Spanish, there is a difference,
and you have to choose which verb to use.
Following is the conjugation of ser in the present tense.
```
```
Ser is used to express seven basic concepts: description, profession, point
of origin, identification, material, possession or ownership, and where an
event takes place.
```

```
Spanish does not translate a/an when stating an unmodified profession.
```
- **Point of origin** (where someone or something is from)

```
Remember
```
```
In common English usage, we often end a sentence with a
preposition, for example, Where are you from? This never occurs in
Spanish; the preposition can never end a sentence. The preposition, in
```

```
this case de , is placed in front of the interrogative word, which in this
case is dónde.
```
- **Identification** (relationship, nationality, or religion)
- **Material** (what something is made of)
- **Possession or ownership**


```
De + el ( of + the ) = del. There are only two contractions in the Spanish
language; del is one of them. When de is followed by the masculine
article el , meaning the , the words contract to del , meaning of the.
```
```
A Word About Possessives
```
```
You can see that these translations are not exact. There is no
apostrophe in Spanish, so when you think of Peter’s car , for example,
the Spanish structure is el carro de Pedro. Make sure you understand
this concept, and use whichever English translation is clearest to you.
```
- **Where an event takes place**

```
An equivalent English translation for is in the examples above is
take/takes place :
```
```
The party takes place at Joe’s house.
The concert takes place at the club.
```

```
The protest takes place in the capital.
Ser is also used to tell time and in impersonal expressions.
```
- **Telling time**

```
Spanish uses the third-person singular or plural of ser for telling time.
La refers to la hora.
```
- **In impersonal expressions**


#### Exercise 16.3

_Complete the following sentences with the correct form of_ **_ser_**_. Indicate
whether the sentence expresses description, profession, point of origin,
identification, material, possession, or an impersonal expression_.

ciudad antigua de los incas, construida en 1450 de piedras enormes y
jardines maravillosos, está en Perú a 120 kilómetros de Cuzco, un pueblo
colonial.

Es el año 1979. Estoy en Cuzco con un grupo turístico. Al principio,
somos un buen grupo. Pero con en el calor insoportable del verano, el
grupo cambia y somos todos contra uno y uno contra todos. En este sitio
tan espiritual, en la cumbre de las montañas de los incas, bajo una vista
majestuosa de las montañas, donde uno está cerca de los dioses de los
incas y lejos de la civilización conocida, somos enemigos mortales.

El bus de regreso está lleno de pasajeros. Son las cuatro de la tarde y
estamos de vuelta. Estoy sola ahora y según el refrán “es mejor estar sola
que mal acompañada”.

## Ser and Estar in the Preterit and Imperfect Tenses

## Preterit Tense

The preterit expresses action completed in the past. The English
translation is usually the simple past. The preterit is used to express the
following:

- An action completed in the past (action with a definite end)
- A series of actions completed in the past
- A condition that is no longer in effect

## Key Vocabulary

This list of words is often used when referring to past actions.

**Adverbios y Adjetivos**


Keep in mind that the action or actions expressed by the preterit have been
completed. It doesn’t make any difference how long the action went on
before; the action has a definite end.

### Estar in the Preterit

The conjugation of **estar** in the preterit follows. Remember the three
primary uses of **estar** : location, health, and changing mood or condition.


### Ser in the Preterit

```
The preterit of ser is used most often for profession and identification.
```

#### Exercise 17.1

```
Complete the following sentences with the correct preterit form of ser or
estar , according to the context of the sentence.
```
1. Ella es profesora hoy, pero antes ___________________ azafata.
2. Yo ___________________ gerente por dos años.
3. Nosotros ___________________ muy contentos ayer porque nos
    ganamos la lotería.
4. ¿Por qué ___________________ Manuel en la cárcel sin decirnos
    nada?
5. Ellos ___________________ en el supermercado hoy para comprar
    alimentos.
6. La semana pasada, Raúl ___________________ en México. Regresó a
    casa ayer.
7. Los muchachos ___________________ enfermos anteayer, pero están
    bien hoy.
8. ___________________ una buena idea.
9. ¿Dónde ___________________ la familia de Federico esta tarde?
10. ¿Quiénes ___________________ en la librería a las nueve y media
esta mañana?


11. Yo ___________________ por irme de vacaciones, pero me faltó
    valor.
12. Nosotros ___________________ de pie la mayor parte del concierto.

### Ser and estar with Description in the

### Preterit

```
On an advanced level, there are situations in which the speaker can decide
whether to use ser or estar in the preterit tense with adjectives. A Spanish
speaker can say, for example:
```
```
With this sentence, the speaker transmits a “categorical” judgment, a
completed absolute fact.
However, a Spanish speaker may choose to say:
```
```
This sentence is more descriptive and represents a “circumstantial”
judgment.
```
##### A Word About Descriptive Judgments

```
When examples such as these are presented to native speakers, all
generally opine that both are correct, and the majority do not find any
perceptible difference between the two. Those who do find some
difference are not always able to articulate exactly what this
difference is.
```

### Imperfect Tense

The imperfect tense expresses action in the past that is not seen as
completed. The imperfect is used to express the following:

- An action that “sets the stage” for another past action
- An action that expresses a narration, background, or situation in the past
- Repeated, habitual, and customary actions in the past
- Continuous actions or actions in progress in the past
- Description in the past
- Point of origin in the past
- Telling time in the past
- Telling one’s age (with **tener** ) in the past

### Estar in the Imperfect


### Ser in the Imperfect


You learned that **ser** can be used in the preterit for profession and
identification. The other uses of **ser** are best served by the imperfect.


### Preterit or Imperfect Determined by the

### Speaker

You can use both the preterit and imperfect tenses in expressing
relationships and in impersonal expressions.

- **Relationships**

```
In this example, the English translations are the same, but when you use
the preterit in Spanish, it means that the action is completed; the
friendship is over.
```
- **Impersonal expressions**


```
The use of the preterit or imperfect in these situations is a choice made
by the speaker; the speaker decides whether the action is completed.
```
#### Exercise 17.2

```
Review ser and estar in the imperfect, then rewrite the following
sentences, changing the verb from the present tense to the imperfect.
```
```
EXAMPLE Mi padre es de Polonia. Mi padre era de Polonia.
```
1. Yo soy de Venezuela. ___________________
2. Ellos son de España. ___________________
3. ¿Qué hora es? ___________________
4. Nosotros estamos bien. ___________________
5. Mi jardín es el más hermoso de la ciudad.
_______________________________________________
6. Los tres amigos están aquí. ___________________
7. No estoy cansada. ___________________
8. Somos cantantes. ___________________
9. ¿Dónde estás? ___________________
10. Yo estoy en la casa con mi hermana.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
#### Exercise 17.3

```
Complete the following sentences with the correct form of ser or estar in
the preterit or imperfect, according to the meaning of the sentence.
```
```
EXAMPLE Lorenzo fue escritor. Ahora es bombero.
```
1. Yo ___________________ camarero. Ahora soy maestro.
2. Nosotros ___________________ en el banco precisamente a las nueve
    esta mañana.


3. Ayer, ___________________ un día de mucha lluvia. Hace buen

### Regular Verbs in the Preterit

```
Most verbs are regular in the preterit tense.
```
### Regular -ar Verbs

```
To conjugate a regular -ar verb in the preterit, drop the ending and add -é,
-aste, -ó, -amos, -asteis, -aron to the stem.
```

##### A Word About Pronunciation

```
Notice that the first- and third-person singular forms carry
written accents. It is very important to practice the
pronunciation, stressing the accented syllable. Pronounce the
verbs in this way: yo canté, tú cantaste, Ud. cantó, nosotros
cantamos, vosotros cantasteis, ellos cantaron. Review the
basic pronunciation rules: All words that end in n, s , or a vowel
have the stress on the second-to-last (penultimate) syllable.
The preterit first-person plural nosotros form is identical to
the present indicative form. Context clarifies whether the verb is
in the present or preterit tense.
```
### Regular -er and -ir Verbs

To conjugate regular **-er** and **-ir** verbs in the preterit, drop the ending and
add **-í, -iste, -ió, -imos, -isteis, -ieron** to the stem. The endings are the
same for both **-er** and **-ir** verbs.

**_-Er_** **Verbs**


**_-Ir_** **Verbs**

```
Notice that the verb ver is regular. It does not carry an accent mark on
the third-person singular form vio , because the form has only one
syllable. The nosotros form of -ir verbs in the preterit is identical to
the present indicative form. Its meaning becomes clear in context.
```

### -Ir Verbs with Stem Changes in the Third

### Person

The following verbs have a stem change in the preterit. This stem change
occurs only in the third-person singular and plural forms of the preterit.

### Irregular Verbs in the Preterit

Verbs that are irregular in the preterit have an irregular stem and a special
set of endings. Note that the endings do not carry accent marks. To
conjugate an irregular verb in the preterit, add the endings **-e, -iste, -o, -
imos, -isteis, -ieron** to the irregular stems.


When the irregular preterit stem ends in **-j** , the third-person endings
become **-o** and **-eron**.

```
Dar, ir , and ser have different sets of endings.
```

##### A Word About haber

```
The third-person singular form of haber in the preterit is hubo ,
meaning there was, there were, was there?, were there?
```
```
It is important to memorize the preterit forms of all the irregular
verbs, so that you will be able to use any verb you wish in the preterit.
```
### Regular Verbs in the Imperfect

#### Regular -ar Verbs

To conjugate a regular **-ar** verb in the imperfect, drop the ending and add **-
aba, -abas, -aba, -ábamos, -abais, -aban** to the stem. The first- and third-
person singular forms ( **yo, él, ella, Ud.** ) are identical.


##### A Word About the Imperfect

```
There are no irregular -ar verbs in the imperfect. Practice the
pronunciation of the verb conjugations above. There are one-syllable,
two-syllable, three-syllable, and four-syllable verbs. Be sure to
pronounce the imperfect in this way: yo trabajaba, tú trabajabas, él
trabajaba, nosotros trabajábamos, vosotros trabajabais, ellos
trabajaban.
```
### Regular -er and -ir Verbs

To conjugate regular **-er** and **-ir** verbs in the imperfect, drop the ending
and add **-ía, -ías, -ía, -íamos, -íais, -ían** to the stem. The endings are the
same for both **-er** and **-ir** verbs. The first- and third-person singular forms
are identical.


**_-Er_** **Verbs**

##### A Word About haber

```
The third-person singular form of haber in the imperfect is había ,
meaning there was, there were, was there?, were there?
```
**_-Ir_** **Verbs**


### Irregular Verbs in the Imperfect

There are only three irregular verbs in the imperfect.

The translation of **ir** in the imperfect is _was going, were going._

### Comparison of Preterit and Imperfect

Remember that the preterit is a completed action. The imperfect is often
an action that was repeated in the past.

```
Marianela
por Benito Pérez Galdós
```
```
Pérez Galdós nació en las Islas Canarias y es mejor conocido por sus
vistas de la sociedad española. Se murió en 1920 en Madrid.
```
```
Aquel día Pablo y Marianela salieron al campo. Con ellos iba Choto, su
perro fiel. El día estaba hermoso. El aire era suave y fresco, y el sol
calentaba sin quemar.
“¿Adónde vamos hoy?” preguntó Pablo, que era ciego de nacimiento.
“Adonde quiera Ud., señor,” contestó Marianela, que era su guía.
Marianela parecía crecer y adquirir nuevas fuerzas, cuando estaba al
lado de su amo y amigo. Junto a él, se sentía llena de alegría. Al apartarse
de él, sentía una profunda tristeza.
Pablo participaba de los mismos sentimientos hacia Marianela. En
cierta ocasión le había dicho Pablo a la joven: Antes yo creía que era de
día cuando hablaba la gente; y que era de noche, cuando la gente callaba y
cantaban los gallos. Ahora, no hago las mismas comparaciones. Es de día
cuando estamos juntos tú y yo; es de noche, cuando nos separamos.
Después de caminar un rato, llegaron a un lugar donde había muchas
flores. Ambos se detuvieron. Pablo se sentó, y Marianela se puso a recoger
flores para su amo. Los dos eran muy felices.

## The Present Progressive Tense

In Spanish, the present progressive tense expresses action that is occurring
at the moment, action that is in progress. It is equivalent to the English
present progressive ( _The woman is singing_ , for example). This tense is
used to express the following:

- An action that is in progress
- An action that is occurring in the moment
- Emphasis for an action that is happening right now

##### A Word About the Present Indicative Tense

```
The present indicative tense in Spanish expresses both the English
simple present ( I sing, I do sing ) and the English present progressive
( I am singing ).
```
When you don’t need to describe what is happening right now, use the
simple present tense.


The present progressive is a compound tense in Spanish, as it is in English.
It is formed by conjugating **estar** in the present tense and adding the
present participle of the main verb. The present participle, hereafter
referred to as the gerund, is the _-ing_ form of a verb in English. The tense is
also called the present continuous.

### Gerund Formation

The gerund is formed by adding **-ando** or **-iendo** to the stem of the
infinitive. In English, the gerund ends in _-ing._ Practice the following verb
forms aloud.

### -Ar Verbs

To form the gerund of all **-ar** verbs, drop the ending and add **-ando** to the
stem.


### -Er Verbs

To form the gerund of most **-er** verbs, drop the ending and add **-iendo** to
the stem.


### -Ir Verbs

To form the gerund of regular **-ir** verbs, drop the ending and add **-iendo** to
the stem.

### Orthographic Changes in -er and -ir Verbs

**-Er** and **-ir** verbs whose stem ends in a vowel form the gerund using **-
yendo** instead of **-iendo** in order to avoid having three vowels in a row.
These are not irregular forms; it is an orthographic change.


**_-Er_** **Verbs**

**_-Ir_** **Verbs**

### The Gerund of Irregular -ir Verbs

Nearly all gerunds are formed regularly. The only verbs that show an
irregularity in the gerund are the **-ir** stem-changing verbs in the present
indicative tense. Learn these irregular gerunds now, and you’ll be able to
form all the gerunds easily.

- Forming the gerund of irregular **-ir** verbs with **o** > **ue** and **o** > **u** changes
    in the stem


- Forming the gerund of irregular **-ir** verbs with **e** > **ie** and **e** > **i** changes
    in the stem

#### Exercise 18.1

Write the gerund of the following infinitives.


### Formation of the Present Progressive

### Tense

To form the present progressive tense, conjugate **estar** in the present tense
and follow it with the gerund of the main verb.


### Use of the Present Progressive Tense

The action expressed by the present progressive tense must be action in
progress.

```
Following are examples formed with estar.
```
NOTE The subject pronoun **Uds.** appears in two different positions in the
example sentences above. In the first example, it comes between the
helping verb **estar** and the gerund. In the second example, **Uds.** follows
the gerund. Both are correct.

```
The negative no comes directly before the conjugated form of estar.
```

##### A Word About English

```
In English, the present progressive tense can be used to describe what
is happening right now as well as what will happen in the future.
I am singing right now.
I am singing next Friday.
In Spanish, the present progressive can never be used to describe a
future action. For a future action, use ir 1 a 1 infinitive.
```
#### Exercise 18.2

_Complete the following sentences with the correct form of the present
progressive tense. Be sure to conjugate_ **_estar_** _correctly._

EXAMPLE Miguel está cantando y su amiga está tocando el piano.
(cantar/tocar)

1. Nuestro profesor ___________________ muchos exámenes. (corregir)
2. Por fin, nosotros ___________________ buenas notas. (sacar)
3. Me hace el favor de no hacer ruido, yo ___________________.
    (estudiar)
4. Los adolescentes les dicen a sus padres, “no ___________________
    nada.” (hacer)
5. Los cocineros ___________________ la cena. ( preparar)
6. ¿Qué ___________________ tú? (decir)
7. Está lloviendo pero no ___________________. (nevar)
8. Ya es tarde y los niños ___________________. (dormir)


9. Son las nueve de la noche y todavía los periodistas
    ___________________. (escribir)
10. ¿Quiénes ___________________ por teléfono? (hablar)
11. Tú ___________________ los huevos para el desayuno. (freír)
12. Son las seis y media y la familia ___________________. (comer)

##### Reminder

```
After a preposition, use the infinitive form of the verb, even though
the translation in English might be the gerund -ing.
```
#### Exercise 18.3

```
Complete the following sentences with the infinitive, present indicative, or
present progressive of the appropriate verb. Select from the list of verbs
below. Use each verb only once.
```
```
almorzar, conocer, devolver, graduarse, hacer, leer, querer, saber, salir,
tener, tocar
```

1. En el avión, en el vuelo de África, parece que los pasajeros están
    ___________________ sus libros de turismo.
2. ¿Quién ___________________ nadar?
3. Olivia sigue ___________________ el violín aunque a su hermano no
    le gusta el sonido.
4. Antes de ___________________ a los padres de su novio, Amalia se
    maquilla la cara.
5. Después de ___________________ éxito en la escuela secundaria, el
    estudiante ___________________ ir a una universidad.
6. Los trabajadores tienen hambre a las doce de la tarde;
    ___________________ juntos a las doce y media;
    ___________________ de la fábrica a las cinco de la tarde.
7. Julia acaba de ___________________ sus libros a la biblioteca.
8. El hombre tiene veintidós años. Después de ___________________ de
    la universidad, no sabe qué ___________________.

### Placement of Object Pronouns

#### Direct Object Pronouns, Indirect Object Pronouns,

#### and Reflexive Pronouns

Following is a review chart of pronouns: subject, direct object, indirect
object, and reflexive.


NOTE In English, the direct object _you_ can be expressed as **la** in Spanish if
the direct object person is female, or **lo** if the direct object person is male.
In many countries, **le** is used as the direct object pronoun instead of **lo** or
**la**. Similarly, the direct object pronoun _you_ in the plural **Uds.** form can be
**las, los** , or **les**.

This use of **le** as direct object pronoun is called **leísmo** ; **le** is borrowed
from the indirect object pronoun.

The indirect object pronouns, direct object pronouns, and reflexive
pronouns have two possible positions:

- The object pronouns may be placed directly before the helping verb
    **estar**.
- The object pronouns may be attached to the gerund.


The written accent retains the correct pronunciation of the verb.

The placement of the object pronouns does not affect the meaning of
the sentence. They can be placed in either position, and the meaning of the
sentence is exactly the same.

### Order of Double Object Pronouns

An indirect object pronoun precedes a direct object pronoun when they
occur together. The reflexive object pronoun precedes the direct object
pronoun when they occur together. The double object pronouns cannot be
separated from one another.

```
Following is a review chart of double object pronouns.
```

##### A Reminder

```
Se replaces le or les as the indirect object pronoun when a direct
object pronoun follows.
```
A reflexive object pronoun precedes the direct object pronoun when they
occur together.

#### Exercise 18.4

_Complete the following sentences with the correct present progressive
form of the verb in parentheses. Remember to conjugate_ **_estar_** _correctly._

1. ¿Por qué ___________________ la pregunta el maestro? (repetir)
2. Los adolescentes no ___________________ las direcciones. (seguir)


3. Nosotros ___________________ el libro. (leer)
4. ¿Quiénes ___________________ tanto ruido? (hacer)
5. Los amigos de Juan ___________________ en casa hoy. (almorzar)
6. Yo ___________________ el agua para preparar la sopa. (hervir)
7. El hombre ama a esta mujer. La ___________________ con su
    mirada. (seguir)
8. Somos nosotros a quienes ellos ___________________. (esperar)

4. ¿En qué estás pensando?
5. ¿Qué está leyendo el profesor?
6. ¿Quién está huyendo de la policía?

### Uses of the Gerund with Verbs Other Than

### estar


After you become accustomed to using the present progressive, you will
find that the gerund can sometimes be used without a helping verb.

Either the gerund or the infinitive can be used after **ver, mirar, escuchar** ,
and **oír**. The meaning is the same.

Verbs not generally used in the gerund form are **ser, estar, poder, querer,
saber, tener, ir** , and **venir**. These verbs use the present indicative instead
of the present progressive.


NOTES **Poder** is the only **-er** verb with an irregularity in the stem of the
gerund: **pudiendo**.

```
The gerund of ir is yendo.
```
#### Exercise 18.7

```
La parada del bus
```
La mujer se llama Lorena. No es ni joven, ni vieja, ni delgada, ni gorda.
Tiene la cara pálida, con ojos marrones y pelo oscuro. No se maquilla
mucho pero se nota que le gusta llevar un poco de colorete. Se ve que es
conservadora por su vestimenta: su falda que cubre las piernas y la blusa
con mangas largas aunque es verano.
Ella llega siempre a la parada del bus, esperando a su esposo. Se puede
pasar por la banca y verla allí sentada, hora tras hora, escribiendo en su
cuaderno y dibujando el rostro de su esposo amado.

Una mañana de mucho calor, un hombre se sienta cerca de ella y
conversa un poco.

Él se llama Roberto; parece ser un buen hombre. Hablan de sus dibujos
y como pasa ella el día. Él se entera que ella está separada de su esposo
desde hace cinco años, pero siendo católicos los dos, son todavía casados.
Roberto, soltero, pasa los días trabajando en computadoras, y sus noches
jugando al ajedrez en un club con otros fanáticos.
Después de veinte minutos, otro bus viene, y el hombre, un poco triste
ahora de dejarla, sube al bus y se va. Ella lo sigue con los ojos con una
mirada llena de soledad. La gente sube al bus; otros se bajan y se van para
la casa. Lorena se queda tranquilamente, extrañando a su esposo,

## The Past Progressive Tenses

There are two progressive tenses in the past: the imperfect progressive and
the preterit progressive. Both express a past action or actions that were
occurring, actions that were in progress. They are equivalent to the English
past progressive: _The people were running_ , for example. These tenses are
used to intensify the following:

- An action that was in progress in the past
- An event that was happening in the past

If you do not want to intensify an action that was in progress in the past,
use the simple imperfect tense:

## The Imperfect Progressive Tense

## Formation of the Imperfect Progressive Tense

The imperfect progressive is a compound tense in Spanish, as it is in
English. It is formed by conjugating **estar** in the imperfect and adding the


gerund of the main verb. The tense is also called the imperfect continuous.

### Uses of the Imperfect Progressive Tense

The action expressed by the imperfect progressive tense must be an action
that was in progress in the past.

```
Following are examples formed with estar.
```
The verbs **seguir, ir** , and **venir** can also be conjugated in the imperfect and
used with the gerund to form the imperfect progressive tense.


Verbs not generally used in the gerund form in the past progressive are **ser,
estar, poder, querer, saber, tener, ir** , and **venir**. These verbs use the
simple imperfect instead of the imperfect progressive.

#### Exercise 19.1

_Translate the following sentences into Spanish, using the imperfect
progressive tense._

1. _I was cleaning the house._

```
_______________________________________________________
```
2. _Rosa continued eating._

```

3. _Pablo was selling medicine to his friends._

8. _Everyone was leaving for the exits._

_______________________________________________________
```
9. _The boys and girls were throwing the ball._

```
_______________________________________________________
```
10. _The politicians were beginning their campaign._

```
_______________________________________________________
```
### The Preterit Progressive Tense

#### Formation of the Preterit Progressive Tense

```
The preterit progressive also emphasizes action that was taking place in
the past. It is formed with the preterit of the verb estar followed by the
gerund of the main verb.
```

### Uses of the Preterit Progressive Tense

Unlike the imperfect progressive, the preterit progressive tense expresses
an action completed in the past. The name of the tense might seem like a
contradiction in terms, but the action, although in a progressive form, is
definitely over.

The gerund is also used with **seguir, venir** , and **ir** to form the preterit
progressive tense.

#### Reading Comprehension

```
El hospital
```
La pobre mamá iba caminando para no mostrarle a su hijo que estaba
preocupada. Ella sabía que no era ni catarro, ni gripe, ni pulmonía. Ella
sabía que era algo grave. De repente, empezó a correr hacia un taxi para
llevárselos a un hospital.

Hacía dos días que su hijo estaba quejándose de un dolor de estómago,
un dolor que no lo dejaba dormir. ¿Qué tiene el hijo? Viviendo sola, Silvia
no tenía nadie con quien hablar a la medianoche. El taxista los dejó en la
entrada del hospital. Ella le pagó y le dio una buena propina. Estuvieron
esperando solamente cinco minutos cuando los médicos llegaron.
Examinaron al niño que estaba llorando. La mamá, llorando también, trató
de ser valiente ante su hijo, pero no pudo. Después de un rato, que le
pareció una eternidad, los médicos le ofrecieron dos opciones: operar o no.
La mamá, sin duda, optó por la operación y firmó el documento de
consentimiento. El niño siguió sollozando.

“Pero mamá,” le dijo el niño, “no quiero que me operen.”
“Yo lo sé, hijo mío, pero es necesario y vas a estar muy bien y sin dolor
después. Los doctores me dijeron que es apendicitis.”

Con esta última conversación, los médicos lo pusieron en la camilla de
operación y ellos desaparecieron en el largo corredor del hospital. La
madre se retiró a la sala de espera, sintiéndose muy desolada en su
soledad.

Ella estaba allá, pensando en su hijo, cuando vinieron los doctores con
las noticias.

“Todo salió bien,” le dijeron, “su hijo está recuperándose en su cuarto y
pronto va a estar riéndose y jugando otra vez.” La mamá aliviada les
agradeció profundamente.


Y dentro de poco, ella y su hijo salieron charlando, ella con la mano
preciosa de su hijo en la suya. Abrazándose, entraron en la casa.

1. ¿Por qué fueron al hospital a la medianoche?

## The Present Subjunctive

The present subjunctive is a mood in the present tense, widely used in
Spanish. The present subjunctive cannot exist alone. Another element in
the sentence always causes it to be used. The subjunctive is often needed
after the following elements:

- Certain impersonal expressions
- Certain verbs
- Certain conjunctions
- Certain dependent adjectives
- Certain expressions

## Formation of the Present Subjunctive

Most verbs form the present subjunctive from the first-person singular **yo**
form of the present indicative. Drop the **-o** to get the stem for the present
subjunctive.

Verbs that are irregular in the present indicative are irregular in the
present subjunctive in the same way.

There are only six verbs that do not form the present subjunctive from
the **yo** form of the present indicative.

## -Ar Verbs


In order to conjugate both regular and irregular **-ar** verbs in the present
subjunctive, start with the **yo** form of the present indicative. Drop the **-o**
and add - **e, -es, -e, -emos, -éis, -en** to the stem.

Note that the first-person and third-person singular forms are identical in
the present subjunctive.

The first two examples, **bailar** and **cantar** , are regular in the present
indicative. The last three, **cerrar, pensar** , and **recordar** , show stem
changes. Note that the stem changes in the present indicative are also
present in the present subjunctive, except in the **nosotros** and **vosotros**
forms, which are unaffected by these stem changes.

##### A Word About the Present Subjunctive


```
The formation of the subjunctive comes from the conjugation of the
first-person singular of the present indicative. Any irregularity that
the verb has in the present indicative yo form also occurs in the
present subjunctive. To learn the subjunctive well, practice the yo
form of the verbs, because that will be the stem of the present
subjunctive.
```
### -Er and -ir Verbs

In order to conjugate both regular and irregular **-er** and **-ir** verbs in the
present subjunctive, drop the **-o** from the first-person singular of the
present indicative and add **-a, -as, -a, -amos, -áis, -an** to the stem.

**_-Er_** **Verbs**

**_-Ir_** **Verbs**


NOTE In the irregular **-ir** verbs, there is an additional irregularity in the
**nosotros** and **vosotros** forms. Verbs with the stem change **e** > **ie** or **e** > **i**
have an **-i-** in the **nosotros** and **vosotros** forms. Verbs with the stem
change **o** > **ue** have a - **u-** in the **nosotros** and **vosotros** forms.

### Irregular -er and -ir Verbs with -g- or -zc-

### in the yo Form

In the present subjunctive, certain **-er** and **-ir** verbs carry the irregularity
of the first-person singular of the present indicative tense throughout the
present subjunctive conjugation. There are no **-ar** verbs that have this
irregularity.


Other regular **-ar** verbs:


Other **-er** verbs like **conocer** :


Other **-ir** verbs with **-zc-** in the **yo** form:

The Spanish equivalent of the English verb meaning _to introduce_ is
**presentar**.

### Irregular Verbs


There are only six verbs whose present subjunctive is not formed from the
first-person singular of the present indicative. They are irregular in that
they are not formed from the **yo** form.

NOTES The present subjunctive form **dé** (from **dar** ) has a written accent to
distinguish it from **de** ( _of_ ).

The word **hay** comes from the infinitive **haber** ; you will not need this
form for any other use at this time.


### Verbs with Orthographic Changes

Verbs with orthographic changes are not irregular. The spelling changes
simply maintain the sound of the **yo** form. Some of the most common
spelling changes are the following:

- Verbs that end in **-car** change **c** to **qu**.
- Verbs that end in **-gar** change **g** to **gu**.
- Verbs that end in **-zar** change **z** to **c**.


NOTE The change **z** > **c** occurs before the vowel **e** without affecting the
sound. The consonants **c** (before **i** and **e** ), **s** , and **z** all have the same sound.

##### A Word About Pronunciation of the Present

##### Subjunctive

```
Like the present indicative, the stress in the present subjunctive is on
the second-to-last syllable. As you practice, make sure you pronounce
the verbs in this way: yo cante, tú cantes, él cante, nosotros
cantemos, ellos canten. If a word carries a written accent, stress the
accented syllable: vosotros cantéis.
```
### Uses of the Present Subjunctive

Remember that the subjunctive mood cannot exist alone; it must always be
caused by some other element in the sentence. This is a mood that
expresses wishes, doubts, and what is possible, rather than what is certain.
The present subjunctive in a dependent clause is caused by the present
tense in the main clause. Following are the specific uses of the present
subjunctive.

### After Certain Impersonal Expressions

A sentence or question may consist of a main clause and a dependent or
subordinate clause connected by the Spanish conjunction **que**.

Following is a sentence with a main clause and a subordinate clause
that are both in the indicative mood.


However, suppose that the main clause has an impersonal expression, such
as **Es dudoso**. This causes the subjunctive to be used in the dependent
clause.

```
Es dudoso que yo cocine bien. It is doubtful that I cook well.
```
```
Following are some frequently used impersonal expressions:
```

When you begin a sentence with one of the impersonal expressions above,
it is mandatory to use the subjunctive in the dependent clause. You do not
have to make any decisions, nor do you have a choice about whether or not
to use it. These impersonal expressions in the main clause always trigger
the subjunctive in the subordinate clause.

Notice that some of the example sentences and questions above are
translated with the future in English. This is because the present
subjunctive carries with it a feeling of the future and doubt.

If you want to make a general statement with an impersonal expression,
there is neither a dependent clause nor a subjunctive. You simply use the
structure you have already learned, which follows English word order.

#### Exercise 20.1

_Complete the following sentences with the correct present subjunctive
form of the verb in parenthes._

EXAMPLE Es urgente que el chofer conduzca con cuidado. (conducir)

1. Es importante que nuestros amigos ___________________ a la fiesta.
    (venir)
2. Es posible que él me ___________________ la verdad. (decir)
3. Es una lástima que Sara no lo ___________________. (hacer)
4. ¿Es posible que Uds. ___________________ a mi amigo Raúl?
    (conocer)
5. Es necesario que nosotros ___________________ bien. (dormir)
6. Es importante que ella ___________________ bien las direcciones.
    (saber)
7. Es necesario que nosotros ___________________ mucha agua fría en
    el verano. (tomar)


8. Es dudoso que ellos ___________________ temprano. (levantarse)
9. ¿Es posible que ella ___________________ a tiempo? (llegar)
10. Es posible que yo ___________________ en Francia. (quedarse)
11. Es probable que mucha gente importante ___________________ en la
conferencia. (estar)
12. Es difícil que yo te ___________________ una buena respuesta. (dar)
13. Es urgente que tú ___________________ al doctor hoy. (ir)
14. Es dudoso que ellos ___________________ ricos. (ser)
15. Es importante que los padres les ___________________ a sus hijos.
(leer)
16. La niña acaba de comer. Es imposible que ___________________
hambre. (tener)
17. Es probable que nosotros le ___________________ flores al profesor.
(traer)
18. Es bueno que Uds. ___________________ mejor. (sentirse)

### After Certain Verbs

#### Expressing Wishes or Preferences

```
Verbs in the main clause that express wishes or preferences with regard to
other people will cause the subjunctive mood in the dependent clause. The
subject in the main clause must be different from the subject in the
dependent clause. Following are verbs that express wishes or preferences:
```
```
Following is a sentence with a main clause and a subordinate clause that
are both in the indicative mood.
```

However, suppose that the main clause has one of the verbs above, such as
**Él quiere**. This causes the subjunctive to be used in the dependent clause:

The English equivalent does not always show the distinction in mood like
Spanish does. But even in the English translation of the example above, it
is clear that the person in the main clause, _he,_ wants the other person, _me,_
to do something.

If there is only one subject for the two verbs in a sentence, there is neither
a dependent clause nor a subjunctive verb.

**Expressing Hope, Happiness, Sadness, or Regret**
Verbs in the main clause that express hope, happiness, sadness, or regret
with regard to other people will cause the subjunctive mood in the
dependent clause. Following are verbs that express hope, happiness,
sadness, or regret:


If there is only one subject for the two verbs in a sentence, the sentence
follows the basic structure that you have learned.

**Expressing Orders, Requests, or Advice**


Verbs in the main clause that express orders, requests, or advice will cause
the subjunctive mood in the dependent clause. Following are verbs that
express orders, requests, or advice:

```
Dejar, mandar, permitir , and prohibir can be used in two ways:
```

As you have learned, **decir** is used to relate a fact. This idea is
expressed with the indicative.

However, when **decir** is used as an order, the subjunctive is used in the
dependent clause.

When English _to tell_ is used to order someone to do something, the
English command form is always the conjugation of the verb _to tell_ +
infinitive.

An English command is expressed as follows: _I tell him_ **_to stay_**. _He tells
me_ **_to go_**. Compare that to simply relating a fact: _He tells me that the bus is
here._

**Expressing Doubt or Uncertainty**

Verbs that express doubt or uncertainty in the main clause will cause the
subjunctive mood in the dependent clause. Following are verbs that
express doubt or uncertainty:


#### Exercise 20.2

```

form of the verb in parentheses.
```
1. ¿Qué quieres que yo te ___________________? (decir)

15. Yo pienso que este hombre ___________________ médico. (ser)
16. A mi hermano no le importa lo que ___________________ yo. (hacer)

### After Certain Conjunctions

```
A subjunctive form follows directly after one of the following
conjunctions if the main clause has a different subject than the dependent
```

clause.

Here is a sentence in which there is only one subject:

In the following sentence, there are two subjects connected by a
conjunction with **que** :

The English equivalent does not show this distinction in mood the way
Spanish does. However, there are clearly two subjects in the example
above: _she_ and _he._
In the example sentences below, there are two subjects in each sentence,
and the subjunctive follows the conjunction:


If there is one subject in the sentence, an infinitive follows the preposition.

Some conjunctions of time always cause the subjunctive, whether there are
two subjects or only one in the sentence. Following are a few conjunctions
of this type:

### After cuando

The subjunctive form directly follows **cuando** if the future is implied.

When **cuando** introduces a question, the indicative form is used.


When **cuando** introduces a sentence that involves either a repeated action
or a general statement in the present, the indicative mood is used.

#### Exercise 20.5

_Complete the following sentences with the conjunction indicated and the
correct form of the verb in parentheses._

EXAMPLE Vamos de vacaciones tan pronto como ( _as soon as_ ) nosotros
podamos ( _to be able to_ ).

1. Él va a limpiar su apartamento ___________________ ( _before_ ) su

### In Certain Dependent Adjective Clauses

```
The subjunctive mood is used in the dependent clause if the object or
person described in the main clause is indefinite or nonexistent. In the
following examples, the objects and persons described in the main clause
are not known.
```

### After the Expressions por más que and por

### mucho que

### After ojalá

An interjection of Arabic origin, **ojalá** means _would to God that_ or _may
God grant that_ and expresses great desire. It can also be translated as _I
hope._

### After acaso, quizás, or tal vez


### After aunque

The subjunctive mood is used if the action has not yet occurred.

If **aunque** introduces a sentence or question that expresses a known fact, a
repeated action, or a general statement in the present, the indicative mood
is used.

### After Compounds of -quiera

Compounds of **-quiera** — **adondequiera** ( _wherever_ ), **cualquiera**
( _whichever_ ), **dondequiera** ( _wherever_ ), and **quienquiera** ( _whoever_ )—all
indicate uncertainty and therefore cause the subjunctive to follow.


### After como

The subjunctive mood is used after **como** only if the meaning is _however._

#### Exercise 20.6

_Complete the following sentences with the correct present subjunctive
form of the verb in parentheses._

1. Tal vez ellos ___________________ por la comida. (enfermarse)
2. Ojalá que nosotros ___________________ hoy. (descansar)
3. Aunque él ___________________ mañana, no quiero lavar el baño.
    (llegar)
4. Por mucho que ellas ___________________ , no van a hacer nada.
    (quejarse)
5. Quienquiera que ___________________ bien puede ser experto.
    (cocinar)
6. Ojalá que tú ___________________ bien esta noche. (dormir)
7. Aunque ___________________ mucho tráfico, queremos viajar.
    (haber)
8. Mi amiga busca un apartamento que ___________________ tres
    cuartos. (tener)

12. Ella busca un novio que ___________________ inteligente. (ser)
13. Quizás él ___________________ la semana que viene. (venir)
14. Por más que Tomás ___________________ , no sabe nada. (hablar)

### Other Tenses That Cause the Present

### Subjunctive

```
You have learned so far that the present indicative in the main clause can
cause the present subjunctive in the subordinate clause. This is the most
common use of the subjunctive mood.
Two additional tenses, the present progressive and the future
periphrastic ( ir 1 a 1 infinitive ) can cause the subjunctive mood as well.
```
### Present Progressive as Cause for the

### Present Subjunctive

```
The present progressive in the main clause can cause the present
subjunctive in the dependent clause.
```

NOTE The present tense and the present progressive are both present tenses.

### Future ( ir + a + infinitive) as Cause for the

### Present Subjunctive

The present subjunctive can also be caused by the future tense in the main
clause.

#### Exercise 20.7

_Complete the following sentences with the correct present subjunctive
form of the verb in parentheses. The verb in the main clause is in the
present indicative. Make sure you know why the present subjunctive is
used in each case._


```
EXAMPLE El doctor me aconseja que yo haga más exámenes médicos.
(hacer)
```
1. Espero que Uds. ___________________ bien. (estar)
2. Nos alegramos mucho de que el sol no te ___________________.

#### Reading Comprehension

Estimados lectores,

Espero que a Uds. les guste la siguiente historia. Está en forma de
diálogo y basada en acontecimientos de la vida real. Intenten adivinar
quien es el personaje principal según las claves que aparecen en esta
escena. Para que gocen de lo lindo y para que aprendan de la historia, es
necesario que Uds. lean con cuidado.
La autora

```
El juicio
```
_La escena tiene lugar en la corte griega ante una asamblea de 501
ciudadanos._

```
El protagonista entra y empieza a hablar.
```

PROTAGONISTA Tengo sesenta años y es la primera vez que me ven en la
corte. ¿Cuál es la primera acusación contra mí?

ACUSADOR Ud. es culpable de investigar bajo la tierra y en el cielo y de
enseñarles a los otros las mismas cosas.

PROTAGONISTA No tengo nada que ver con estas acusaciones y no es verdad.
ACUSADOR Pero, ¿cuál es el problema, entonces? ¿Por qué hay tantos
prejuicios contra Ud. si no hace algo diferente de los demás? Nos puede
decir Ud. lo que es, para que le demos un veredicto justo.

PROTAGONISTA Bueno. Voy a decirles toda la verdad. Me dan esta
reputación por cierta sabiduría que tengo. Menciono el dios de Delfos
para que él sea mi testigo. ¿Se acuerdan Uds. de Querefón? Él fue al
dios de Delfos y le preguntó si hay una persona más sabia que yo. El
dios contestó que no hay nadie. Pero, ¿qué significa la idea de que yo
soy el hombre más sagaz de todos? Me tocó investigar la cuestión. Yo
fui a ver a un hombre que tiene la reputación de ser sagaz. Lo examiné.
No es necesario que les diga su nombre, él es un político, y esto es el
resultado.
Cuando yo hablé con él, me di cuenta que él no era sabio. Cuando me
fui, pensaba, “Yo soy más sabio que este hombre; ninguno de nosotros
no sabe nada que valga la pena saber, pero él piensa que él tiene la
sabiduría cuando él no la tiene, y yo, sin saber nada, no pienso que yo
sea sagaz. No pienso que sé lo que no sé.” Después, fui a ver a los
poetas, pensando que ellos iban a ser más sagaces que yo. Pero
averigüé que no es por la sabiduría que los poetas crean sus poemas
sino por una inspiración divina. Por fin, fui a ver a los artesanos. Ellos
sabían lo que yo no sabía y por eso eran más sabios que yo. Pero me
pareció que cada uno se creía extremadamente sagaz en cuestiones
importantes porque eran hábiles en su propio arte.
Mucho prejuicio contra mi ha resultado de mi investigación. Y yo
sigo investigando y examinando a cada persona que pienso es sagaz y si
él no es sagaz yo se lo digo. Estoy tan ocupado en mi investigación que
no he tenido tiempo ni para servir en posiciones del estado ni de ganar
dinero. Como resultado, yo soy pobre. Es verdad lo que les dije. Y yo
sé que por esta investigación de la gente hay mucha rabia contra mí.
Pero lo que Uds. escuchan es mi defensa contra estas primeras
acusaciones.

## Commands

The command form, also called the imperative, is used to tell someone to
do or not to do something. The command form is considered a mood, and
exists only in the immediate present. The Spanish affirmative command is
equivalent to English commands, such as _turn here_ or _follow the
directions._ The Spanish negative command is equivalent to English _don’t
scream_ or _don’t drink the water,_ for example. Except for the affirmative **tú**
command, all the constructions use a form that is the same as the present
subjunctive, so your knowledge of the subjunctive is a great help.
Even though there are other ways to request that people do things, the
command form is necessary in many situations. For example, let’s say you
need to give someone directions:

```
Go straight ahead, and then turn to the right.
Follow the red line.
Walk in the direction of the traffic.
```
Sometimes you need the command form to tell people not to do
something, and you don’t have very much time to do it in.

```
Don’t touch the light socket!
Don’t jump in the water—there are sharks!
Don’t move.
Don’t worry.
```
## Affirmative tú Commands


The affirmative command form in the familiar **tú** is the same as the third-
person singular of the present indicative. If the third-person indicative
form is irregular, so is the command form.

### -Ar Verbs

### -Er and -ir Verbs

### Irregular tú Commands

The following are the only irregular commands in the affirmative **tú** form.
It is a good idea to learn these imperatives right away.


NOTE The command form can be softened by adding **por favor** ( _please_ ).

#### Exercise 21.1

_Translate the following regular_ **tú** _commands into English._

1. Toma tu medicina y llama al doctor en la mañana.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
2. Sigue a la derecha, por favor.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
3. Cierra la puerta, por favor, y abre la ventana.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
4. Corre a la tienda y compra la leche.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
5. Prepara la comida esta noche y después, saca la basura, por favor.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
6. Lee _Don Quixote_ para la clase y escribe tu opinión acerca del tema
    principal.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
7. Come más frutas y verduras.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
8. Cuenta conmigo.

```
_______________________________________________________
```

#### Exercise 21.2

_Write the affirmative_ **tú** _command form for the following verbs._

#### Exercise 21.3

_Complete the following sentences with the_ **tú** _command form of the verb in
parentheses. Both regular and irregular commands are included._

EXAMPLE ¿Por qué no vienes acá? Ven acá.

1. Tú nunca dices la verdad. ___________________ la verdad. (decir)
2. Tú debes portarte bien. ___________________ un buen niño. (ser)
3. ___________________ tu pregunta, por favor. (leer)
4. ___________________ el correo electrónico. (escribir)
5. Hay mucho peligro en la selva. ___________________ cuidado.
    (tener)
6. ___________________ la ropa en el cajón, por favor. (poner)
7. ___________________ acá. (venir)


8. Tú te vas a engordar si no haces ejercicios. ___________________
    ejercicios por lo menos tres veces a la semana. (hacer)
9. Necesitamos arroz para preparar la comida. ___________________ el
    arroz, por favor. (traer)
10. ___________________ a tu hermanita. (esperar)

### Placement of Object Pronouns with

### Affirmative tú Commands

```
All object pronouns are attached to the affirmative form of the imperative.
When two object pronouns occur together, the indirect object pronoun
precedes the direct object pronoun.
```

NOTE The written accent maintains the stress on the correct syllable in the
imperative: **escribe, escríbeme, escríbemela** , for example.

In Spanish, the reflexive command form is very important. The reflexive
object pronoun is attached the affirmative command form, and the written
accent is again used to maintain stress on the correct syllable. Practice
these examples aloud.

When a reflexive object pronoun and a direct object pronoun occur
together, the reflexive object pronoun precedes the direct object pronoun.

#### Exercise 21.4

_Write the affirmative_ **tú** _command form for the following verbs. All
responses require a written accent to maintain stress on the correct
syllable, except_ **irse**. _Pronounce each response aloud._


### Negative tú Commands

The negative **tú** command form is the same as the present subjunctive
form.

To form the negative **tú** command, begin with the **yo** form of the
present indicative tense. Drop the final **-o** to get the stem of the present
subjunctive.

- For **-ar** verbs, add **-es** to the stem.
- For **-er** and **-ir** verbs, add **-as** to the stem.

### -Ar Verbs


### -Er and -ir Verbs

Pronounce the commands listed above aloud. Take time to write down both
the affirmative and negative commands you need in everyday life,
pronounce them, and try to learn them by memory. The negative
commands are very important.

### Placement of Object Pronouns with

### Negative tú Commands

All object pronouns precede the verb in a negative command. The indirect
object pronoun precedes the direct object pronoun if they appear together.


The reflexive object pronoun also precedes the verb in a negative **tú**
command.

If a reflexive verb and a direct object appear in the same phrase, the
reflexive object pronoun precedes the direct object pronoun.

### Ud. and Uds. Commands

```
The command forms for Ud. and Uds. are identical to the present
subjunctive.
```
- To form the **Ud./Uds.** commands for **-ar** verbs, begin with the **yo** form
    of the present indicative. Drop the **-o** and add **-e** ( **Ud.** ) or **-en** ( **Uds.** ) to
    the stem.
- To form the **Ud./Uds.** commands for **-er** and **-ir** verbs, begin with the **yo**
    form of the present indicative. Drop the **-o** and add **-a** ( **Ud.** ) or **-an**
    ( **Uds.** ) to the stem.
- There are only five irregular **Ud./Uds.** command forms. All regular
    **Ud./Uds.** commands are formed from the **yo** form of the present


```
indicative.
```
**Affirmative** **_Ud._** **Commands**

**_-Ar_** **Verbs**

NOTE The command can be softened by adding **Ud.** or **Uds.**

**_-Er_** **and** **_-ir_** **Verbs**

**Negative** **_Ud._** **Commands**

The verb form for negative **Ud.** commands is the same as the present
subjunctive. Affirmative and negative **Ud.** command forms are identical.


**Affirmative** **_Uds._** **Commands**

Add an **-n** to the **Ud.** form of the imperative to form the **Uds.** command.

**_-Ar_** **Verbs**

**_-Er_** **and** **_-ir_** **Verbs**

**Negative** **_Uds._** **Commands**

Pronounce the commands listed above aloud. Now list the commands that
you need in everyday life. Make your own list of commands and practice
them.

### Placement of Object Pronouns with

### Affirmative Ud./Uds. Commands

The reflexive, indirect, and direct object pronouns are attached to the
affirmative command. When an object is added to the command form, a
written accent is placed over the stressed syllable to maintain the sound of
the verb.


**Affirmative** **_Ud._** **Commands**

**Affirmative** **_Uds._** **Commands**

NOTE The **-nn-** combination is very rare in Spanish.

### Placement of Object Pronouns with

### Negative Ud./Uds. Commands

The reflexive, indirect, and direct object pronouns precede the verb in a
negative **Ud./Uds.** command. The verb forms for affirmative and negative
commands are the same.

**Negative** **_Ud._** **Commands**


**Negative** **_Uds._** **Commands**

### Review of Ud./Uds. Commands

#### Regular Ud./Uds. Commands

**Irregular** **_Ud./Uds._** **Commands**

There are only five **Ud./Uds.** command forms that are not formed from the
**yo** form of the present indicative.


NOTE Remember that commands such as **diga, haga** , and **tenga** are not
irregular. They are formed from the **yo** form of the present indicative
tense.

### Other Ways of Asking People to Do Things

- **Favor de** + _infinitive_ (easy to use and very polite)
- **Tener la bondad de** + _infinitive_
- **Puede Ud.** + _infinitive_


- **Hacer el favor de** + _infinitive_ with _indirect object_ (similar to **favor de** )
- Present indicative with _indirect object pronoun_ or _direct object pronoun_

##### A Word About the Word “Will”

```
In all of the constructions mentioned above, the English translation
using the word “will” does not indicate a future tense, but rather a
voluntary mood.
```

_Translate the following sentences into English, then pronounce these
commands aloud._

1. No naden en este lago.

#### Reading Comprehension

```
Perdida en Nicaragua
```
“Vaya recto hasta llegar a la iglesia. Cuando llegue a la iglesia, doble a la
derecha.

“Siga recto hasta llegar al ayuntamiento; camine diez minutos más,
suba una colina, cruce la calle y ya está en la universidad. Si sale ahora, va
a llegar mucho antes de su primera clase a las diez.”

El año era 1987. Eran las siete de una mañana caliente y húmeda como
siempre era en agosto en Managua. Empecé mi caminata con mucha
confianza y alegría, siendo muy independiente. Caminé con las
direcciones escritas en un papelito. Después de quince minutos comencé a
prestar mucha atención, buscando la iglesia blanca y grande como era la
descripción de ella. La temperatura siguió subiendo. No vi a nadie para
pedir direcciones. No hallé ninguna iglesia, ni grande, ni pequeña, ni
blanca ni de otros colores.

Desesperada, di la vuelta y seguí la misma pista que me trajo hasta este
punto y volví a la pensión. Sudada, miré al grupo, todos alegres, comiendo
el desayuno y charlando.


“Nunca vi la iglesia,” les relaté a los dueños. Mis colegas me miraron sin
poder aguantar la risa.

“Ah,” me contestaron. “Ud. no es nicaragüense y no conoce bien ni la
ciudad ni esta área. Le dirigimos adonde la iglesia estaba antes de la
guerra.”

### The nosotros Command: “Let us.. .”

“ _Let’s_ do something,” or “ _Let’s not_ do something” expresses the **nosotros**
command forms. The **nosotros** command forms are the same as the
present subjunctive.

Begin with the present indicative **yo** form of the verb, and drop the **-o**.
That gives you the stem for the command form.

- For **-ar verbs** , add **-emos** to the stem.
- For **-er** and **-ir** verbs, add **-amos** to the stem.
- The affirmative and negative **nosotros** commands have the same form.

**_-Ar_** **Verbs**

**_-Er_** **and** **_-ir_** **Verbs**


The indirect object pronouns and direct object pronouns are attached to the
affirmative command.

The negative **nosotros** command form is the same as the affirmative
**nosotros** command form. The object pronouns (reflexive, indirect, and
direct) precede the command.

**Vamos** is used instead of **vayamos** for _let’s go._ In the negative, **vayamos**
is used.

In the affirmative **nosotros** command form of a reflexive verb, the final **-s**
is dropped before the **-nos** is added.


The final **-s** of the command form is dropped if the indirect object pronoun
**se** is added. The **-s** is dropped before the **se** is added. This is done to
eliminate the **-ss-** combination.

In the stem-changing **-ir** verbs, there is an irregularity in the **nosotros**
command form. Verbs with the **e** > **ie** or **e** > **i** change in the stem have an **-
i-** in the stem of the **nosotros** command. Verbs with the **o** > **u** change in the
stem have a **-u-** in the stem of the **nosotros** command. This is the same
stem change seen in the present subjunctive.


#### Exercise 21.11

_Write the affirmative_ **nosotros** _command for the following verbs._


### Affirmative vosotros Commands

The **vosotros** form is used only in Spain. The affirmative, familiar plural
**vosotros** command is formed by dropping the final **-r** of the infinitive and
adding **-d**. There are no exceptions.


In the affirmative **vosotros** command, both the direct and indirect object
pronouns are attached to the verb form.

In the affirmative **vosotros** command of a reflexive verb, the final **-d** is
dropped before the **-os** is added:

### Negative vosotros Commands

The negative **vosotros** command is the same as the subjunctive. The
reflexive, indirect, and direct object pronouns precede the verb.


For the negative **vosotros** command, as for the affirmative **nosotros**
command, stem-changing **-ir** verbs show an irregularity in the command
form. Verbs with the **e** > **ie** or **e** > **i** change in the stem have an **-i-** in the
stem of the **vosotros** command. Verbs with the **o** > **u** change in the stem
have a **-u-** in the stem of the **vosotros** command. This is the same as is
found in the present subjunctive.

##### A Word About the vosotros Command

```
The vosotros command is used only in Spain. It is good to know this
form, however, especially when you begin to read literature by
Spanish writers, or if you are planning a trip to Spain.
```
#### Exercise 21.12

La Noche de Brujas

```
“Ven acá m’hija,” dijo su padre. “Ven acá para que yo pueda verte de
cerca. Qué bonita estás en tu disfraz.”
“Vuelve a las nueve como nos prometiste,” le pidió su madre. “Y no
hables con nadie, sino con tu grupito de chicas.”
“Sí, no se preocupen.” Y después, le murmura a su papá para que su
mamá no la oiga: “Tú sabes, papá, que mamá va a seguirme,
escondiéndose, detrás de los árboles.”
“Eres muy lista. Yo no sabía que tú sabías. Ten cuidado, niñita, y no
cruces la calle sin mirar en ambas direcciones.”
“Sí, sí, papá.” Les cantó a sus padres el canto de la Noche de Brujas:
“Triqui triqui Halloween, quiero dulces para mí,” y se fue.
El papá las mira salir; primero su hija, y después su esposa. Sus dos
mujeres; una mayor, la otra menor. Él se sienta en su sillón favorito, en la
casa cómoda, entre sus libros. Pasan las nueve; pasan las diez y nadie
llegó. Empezó a oír todos los sonidos de la casa, el reloj, la radio, el viento
contra la ventana, menos el sonido que él quería oír—las voces de su
esposa e hija, llenas de cuentos de sus aventuras.

## Nouns, Articles, Adjectives, and Pronouns

## Nouns and Articles

A noun is a person, place, or thing. In Spanish, all nouns are either
masculine or feminine. The definite article ( **el, la, los, las** _),_ agrees with its
noun in gender and number, as does the indefinite article ( **uno, una, unos,
unas** ).

Most of the time, inclusion of the article in Spanish is the same as it is
in English.

Similarly, omission of the article in Spanish often corresponds to English
usage.


##### A Word About the Definite Article

```
Even without many rules, you will be able to use the articles
effectively.
```
### Inclusion and Omission of Articles

Spanish does not translate _a/an_ when stating an unmodified profession. If
the profession is modified, the indefinite article ( **un/una** ) becomes
necessary.

The definite article is used with days of the week. The English word _on_ is
not translated.


The only time the article is omitted when expressing the day of the week is
following a form of **ser**.

The definite article is used with seasons of the year, even though the
English equivalent may not include it.

The definite article is used after forms of **gustar** and verbs that are used
like **gustar** (for example, **doler, encantar, fascinar, importar** ), whether
the English translation includes it or not.

The Spanish definite article never follows a form of **haber**. Nouns,
adjectives, and indefinite articles can follow **haber** , but not the definite
article ( **el, la, los, las** ).


When the verb **hablar** is followed by the name of a language, the definite
article is omitted.

The definite article is used in front of each noun if there is more than one
noun stated, as in a series.

The definite article is used with the name of subject matter.


The definite article is used before a noun in a general statement.

The definite article is used before abstract nouns.

The definite article is used to refer to all members of a class.

The definite article is used in front of a personal title in Spanish, even
when it is not used in the English equivalent.

The definite article is omitted before a personal title when the person is
being addressed directly.

NOTE The definite article is not used in front of **don/doña** or
**Santo/San/Santa**. **Santo** is used only before words beginning with **Do-** or
**To-** ( **Santo Domingo** and **Santo Tomás** , for example). **Santo** becomes **San**
when used before words beginning with any other letters.


The definite article is used before nouns of measurement, where it carries
the meaning _per._

When two nouns are joined by **de** to form a compound noun, the definite
article is omitted before the second noun.

The article is omitted before ordinal numbers in the names of kings,
queens, and other rulers.


Before an apposition, which is a noun or noun phrase that is used in the
same way and describes the same thing as the noun before it, the definite
article is omitted.

#### Exercise 22.1

**Definite article or not?** _Complete the following sentences with the correct
definite article where it is necessary. Mark an_ **X** _where no article is
needed._

1. Quiero que mi hermano me dé ___________________ libro de
    ___________________ medicina.
2. Yo soy ___________________ abogado pero no me gusta
    ___________________ ley.
3. Francamente, yo fumo pero sé que ___________________ cigarrillos
    son malos para ___________________ salud.
4. ¿Qué quiere hacer ___________________ verano que viene?
5. El gobernador tuvo un accidente y le dolieron mucho
    ___________________ costillas.
6. ¿Son buenas ___________________ computadoras?
7. Hugo Chávez, ___________________ presidente de Venezuela, le da
    gasolina a ___________________ gente pobre.
8. A ___________________ familia le encantan ___________________
    vacaciones.


9. Sinceramente, el mesero no sabe si ___________________ comida
    está buena en este restaurante.

### Possessive Adjectives

A possessive adjective agrees in gender and number with the noun it
modifies.

### Short-Form Possessive Adjectives

A short-form possessive adjective precedes the noun it modifies.

**mi, mis** _my_

**tu, tus** _your_ ( **tú** form)

**su, sus** _your_ ( **Ud./Uds.** forms), _his, her, their_

In Spanish, a single form ( **su/sus** ) expresses the third-person possessive
for _your_ ( **Ud./Uds.** forms), _his, her,_ and _their._ This means that **su/sus** can
be ambiguous, so the construction noun + **de** + pronoun is often used to
clarify the meaning.


**nuestro, nuestra, nuestros, nuestras** _our_

**vuestro, vuestra, vuestros, vuestras** _your_ ( **vosotros** form)

Like **vosotros** , this form is used only in Spain. It is explained here so that
you will be aware of it, but when you need the word for _your_ in Spanish,
use **su/sus**.

#### Exercise 22.2

_Complete the following sentences with the most appropriate possessive
adjective from the list below._

**mi, mis, tu, tus, su, sus, nuestro, nuestra, nuestros, nuestras**

1. Soy estudiante: ___________________ libros están en la mesa.
2. Él es un buen profesor; ___________________ cursos son
    interesantes.
3. Ellos son abogados; ___________________ clientes pueden ser
    culpables o inocentes.


4. Nuestra amiga es maestra; ___________________ padres enseñan
    también.
5. Ella es mi suegra; ___________________ casa está en México.
6. El cuñado de Cecilia es carpintero: ___________________ nombre es
    Manuel.
7. Liliana está en Texas; ___________________ familia vive en Arizona.
8. Vivo con cuatro amigos, un gato y un conejo; ___________________
    casa es grande.
9. Somos principiantes; ___________________ tarea es difícil.
10. La hija de Beatriz es doctora; ___________________ hijo es
arquitecto.

### Long-Form Possessive Adjectives

```
Spanish also has a set of long-form possessive adjectives that are used to
stress one possessor over another:
```
```
This is my car, not your car.
```
```
They are used less frequently than the short-form possessive adjectives.
```
- Long-form possessive adjectives are placed after the noun, and they
    agree in gender and number with the noun they modify. All have four
    forms that indicate both gender and number.
- Long-form possessive adjectives are used to emphasize the possessor,
    and they are the equivalent of the English _of mine, of yours, of his, of_
    _hers, of theirs, of ours._
- Long-form possessive adjectives are used in direct address and
    exclamations: **¡Dios mío!** for example.

```
mío, mía, míos, mías my, of mine
```

**tuyo, tuya, tuyos, tuyas** _your_ ( **tú** form), _of yours_

**suyo, suya, suyos, suyas** _your_ ( **Ud./Uds.** forms), _of yours; his, of his; her,
of hers; their, of theirs_

Remember that in Spanish there is only one form for the third-person
possessive adjective. This means that **suyo/suya/suyos/suyas** can be
ambiguous. The construction noun + **de** + pronoun or noun is used to
clarify the meaning.


**nuestro, nuestra, nuestros, nuestras** _our, of ours_

**vuestro, vuestra, vuestros, vuestras** _your_ ( **vosotros** form), _of yours_

Long-form possessive adjectives can also occur with the indefinite article
— **un, uno, una, unos, unas**.


#### Exercise 22.3

_Complete the following sentences with the correct possessive adjective,
according to the cue in parentheses._

1. Querido amigo _________________ , ¿vienes a visitarme? ( _of mine_ )
2. El libro _________________ es más pesado que el libro
    _________________. ( _yours/mine_ )
3. Tus zapatos son viejos; los zapatos _________________ son costosos
    y nuevos. ( _of hers_ )
4. A los dos compañeros de cuarto siempre se les pierden las llaves.
    Afortunadamente, tienen otras llaves _________________. ( _of theirs_ )
5. Unas primas _________________ quieren ir a México; la otra no
    quiere viajar. ( _of mine_ )
6. La idea de Ofelia es mala; la idea _________________ es mejor. ( _our_ )
7. Favor de venir acá, hijo _________________. ( _of mine_ )
8. Los guantes de Rebeca son de cuero; los guantes _________________
    son de algodón. ( _of theirs_ )

### Possessive Pronouns

A pronoun takes the place of a noun. A possessive pronoun tells who owns
or possesses the noun it is replacing.

```
Your bicycle is yellow. Mine is red.
```

**_Mine_** is used instead of _my bicycle,_ and it is a possessive pronoun because
it replaces the noun, _bicycle,_ and tells who owns the noun.

### Formation and Uses of Possessive

### Pronouns

- A possessive pronoun agrees in number and gender with the thing
    possessed.
- A possessive pronoun is similar to the possessive adjective. In most
    sentences and questions, it is used with the definite article.
- The definite article is omitted before the possessive pronoun only when
    the possessive pronoun is followed by a form of **ser**.

**el mío, la mía, los míos, las mías** _mine_

Notice how important gender is in the use of possessive pronouns in
Spanish. It is clear that **el mío** replaces **tu carro** , because it is masculine.
Similarly, **la mía** replaces **su casa** because it is feminine.

**el tuyo, la tuya, los tuyos, las tuyas** _yours_ ( **tú** form)

**el suyo, la suya, los suyos, las suyas** _yours_ ( **Ud./Uds.** forms), _his, hers,
theirs_


Remember that the third-person possessive pronouns, both singular and
plural, are often ambiguous. **Prefiero la suya** can be translated as _I prefer
his, I prefer yours,_ or _I prefer theirs,_ in addition to _I prefer hers._ It can be
clarified in the following manner: **Prefiero la casa de él / de ella / de Ud.
/ de ellos / de ellas / de Uds.**

**el nuestro, la nuestra, los nuestros, las nuestras** _ours_

**el vuestro, la vuestra, los vuestros, las vuestras** _yours_ ( **vosotros** form)


#### Exercise 22.4

_Complete the following sentences with the correct possessive pronoun,
according to the cue in parentheses._

1. El himno nacional de Canadá es más bonito que _________________.
    ( _ours_ )
2. Nuestros tíos vinieron a vernos ayer. ¿Cuándo vienen
    _________________? ( _yours_ )
3. Enrique quiere vender su cámara. Me gusta _________________ ,
    pero voy a comprar _________________. ( _his/yours_ )
4. La mujer quería llevar su chaqueta en clase, pero yo tenía calor, y me
    quité _________________. ( _mine_ )
5. Los hijos de Sonia se duermen a las ocho todas las noches;
    _________________ se duermen a las nueve. ( _ours_ )
6. Esta alcoba es más pequeña que _________________. ( _mine_ )
7. Este hotel de tres estrellas es menos cómodo que
    _________________. ( _ours_ )
8. ¿Cuál de los pasteles desea Ud.? El pastel que deseo es más sabroso
    que _________________. ( _yours_ )

### Omission of the Article Following ser with

### Possessive Pronouns

When a possessive pronoun follows any form of **ser** , the article ( **el, la, los,
las** ) is omitted.


#### Exercise 22.5

_Complete the following sentences with the correct possessive pronoun,
according to the cue in parentheses. In these sentences, it appears after a
form of_ **ser**.

1. El libro es _________________. ( _mine_ )
2. Estos espejos son _________________. ( _yours_ )
3. Los mapas son _________________. ( _ours_ )
4. Los gatos son _________________. ( _his_ )


5. La planta es _________________. ( _hers_ )
6. La televisión es _________________. ( _theirs_ )

#### Exercise 22.6

_Complete the following sentences with the correct possessive pronoun,
according to the cue in parentheses. In these sentences, it appears after a
word other than a form of_ **ser**.

1. Mi libro está aquí. ¿Dónde está _________________? ( _yours_ )
2. El chaleco guatemalteco cuesta veinte pesos. ¿Cuánto cuesta
    _________________? ( _his_ )
3. El maestro tiene su libro. ¿Quién tiene _________________? ( _mine_ )
4. Los carros de Jaime son costosos; son mejores que
    _________________. ( _ours_ )
5. No tengo una buena maleta para mi viaje. ¿Me puedes prestar
    _________________? ( _yours_ )
6. ¿Hay platos para la fiesta? ¿Nos pueden Uds. traer
    _________________? ( _yours_ )

### Relative Pronouns

Relative pronouns are related to a noun that has been previously stated.

**_Que_**

**Que** , meaning _that, which,_ or _who,_ is the most commonly used, all-
purpose relative pronoun in Spanish. Referring to persons, places, or
things, it comes right after the noun to which it refers.


**Que** is also used after prepositions. As the object of a preposition, **que**
refers to a thing or things only, not to a person or persons.

**_Quien_**

**Quien** means _who_ and is used instead of **que** when a form of **ser** is used in
the main clause.

**Quien** and **quienes** , meaning _whom,_ are used after prepositions to refer to
people.

**_Cuyo, cuya, cuyos, cuyas_**

**Cuyo** , which means _whose,_ can serve as a relative pronoun or relative ad-
jective. It most often acts as an adjective, however, because it typically
precedes the noun that it modifies and agrees with it in gender and number.


**_Lo que_**

**Lo que** means _that which_ and is often translated as _what._ It is a neuter
relative pronoun and refers to an abstract idea.

When **lo que** is used to mean _whatever,_ it is followed by the present
subjunctive.

#### Exercise 22.7

_Complete the following sentences with the appropriate relative pronoun.
Choose from the list below._


```
lo que, que, quien, quienes, cuyo
```
1. Sabemos _________________ Luisa sabe.
2. Los hombres, _________________ jugaban tenis contra sus esposas,
    perdían.
3. Este hotel, en _________________ pasamos nuestras vacaciones, es
    maravilloso.
4. Samuel y su hermano, _________________ viven en el décimo piso,
    son carpinteros.
5. Graciela tiene dos nietos con _________________ viaja.
6. Ella tiene un bastón con _________________ caminar.
7. _________________ Raúl hace no le sirve.
8. ¿Eres tú _________________ baila bien?
9. Somos nosotros _________________ cantan bien.
10. ¿Entendieron Uds. _________________ yo les enseñé?
11. ¿Compraste la casa _________________ me gustó?
12. No tengo nadie con _________________ hablar.
13. A este hombre _________________ esposa tiene tres coches no le
gusta manejar.
14. Mi mejor amigo, _________________ hermanos bailan y cantan, toca
bien el violín.

#### Exercise 22.8

```
Translate the following sentences into English.
```
1. Rita vendió la casa que me gustó.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
2. Lo que Ud. dijo era verdad.

```
_______________________________________________________
```
3. No sé si este hombre conocido, que estudia la filosofía, quiere ir a
    Grecia con sus amigos.


###### _______________________________________________________

### El que, la que, los que, las que

**El que** and its related forms are translated as _that, which, who, the one
that, the ones that, the one who,_ and _the ones who._ They refer to people or
things, show gender and number, and can be used instead of **que** for
emphasis or clarification. **Que** is used much more in conversation, while
the forms of **el que** are used more in written Spanish. This form is not
commonly used in speech as a connector. It is good to know these forms,
but for conversation, you’ll probably use **que**.

### El cual, la cual, los cuales, las cuales

**El cual** and its related forms also mean _that, which,_ or _who._ They are
interchangeable with **el que, la que, los que** , and **las que**. Like the latter
forms, these are used more in writing than in speech.

This form replaces **que** when there is some doubt about the reference,
or if the relative pronoun is at a distance from the antecedent. These
relative pronouns also show gender and number, so they are used to avoid
confusion when there is more than one possible noun to which they might
refer.


**El cual** and its related forms are most frequently used after prepositions
other than **a, de, con** and **en**. They are especially common with compound
prepositions.

NOTE **La razón por la cual** is translated _the reason why_ in English.
Literally, the translation is _the reason through which._

#### Exercise 22.9

_Complete the following sentences with the most appropriate relative
pronoun._


1. Es ella ___________________ lo ama.
2. Yo sabía ___________________ los estudiantes estaban alegres.
3. Muchas personas murieron durante la guerra ___________________
    no era necesaria.
4. La razón por ___________________ Paulina y Raúl se enamoraron es
    obvia.
5. Las vacas y los búfalos comen hierba, ___________________ dan
    leche.
6. Susana necesita un bastón con ___________________ andar.
7. Ella necesita una persona con ___________________ estar.
8. Es un buen barrio en ___________________ vivir.
9. ¿Cuál es el tema de ___________________ tú hablas?
10. ¿A ___________________ buscan Uds.?
11. ¿Es ésta la puerta por ___________________ entramos?

### Demonstrative Adjectives and Pronouns

```
The demonstrative adjectives and demonstrative pronouns look similar.
```
### Demonstrative Adjectives

### Demonstrative Pronouns


Demonstrative pronouns carry a written accent.

The demonstrative pronoun replaces the noun. Whereas **este libro**
means _this book,_ **éste** (referring to **el libro** ) means _this one_ and replaces **el
libro** ( _the book_ ). The pronunciation is the same for both forms.

There are three neuter demonstrative pronouns that do not carry written
accents. They refer to an object that is not known, a statement, or a general
idea.


#### Reading Comprehension

```
Mi viaje
```
Estoy preparándome para mis vacaciones en México y se me perdió el
pasaporte. ¿Es necesario que yo tenga un pasaporte? Pienso que sí. ¿A
quién le pregunto? Debo llamar a mi amigo Juan que viaja mucho.

Ojalá que sepa. El año pasado viajó a Oaxaca, una ciudad en México la
cual está a seis horas por bus desde la capital. Le gustó mucho o me dijo
que le gustó.
Estoy pensando en ir a los Galápagos también donde las tortugas viven
más de cien años y los animales y los pájaros actúan como dueños de la
isla porque no les tienen miedo a los turistas, los cuales pasean por las
islas todo el día, día tras día. Si Juan no está en casa, lo voy a llamar a su
celular, el que lleva consigo todo el tiempo. ¿Cuál es su número de
teléfono? Se me olvidó.

### The Neuter lo + Adjective Used as a Noun

The neuter article **lo** followed by the masculine form of an adjective acts
as a noun.

The neuter article **lo** followed by **de** means _the matter of, the issue of._


### Expressions with lo

#### Exercise 22.10

_Complete the following sentences with the correct form of the article:_ **el,
la, los, las** _, or_ **lo**. _In some cases, the article is part of the contraction_ **al**.

omitted.
```

3. Al hombre le gustan dos apartamentos: un apartamento grande y
    costoso y otro apartamento mediano y barato. Decide comprar
    ___________________. ( _the big one_ )

### Pronouns Used as Nouns

Pronouns are words that refer to a noun or take the place of a noun.


### El de, la de, los de, las de

The articles **el, la, los, las** followed by **de** can replace a noun when that
noun is omitted.

### El que, la que, los que, las que

The articles **el, la, los, las** followed by **que** can replace a noun when that
noun is omitted.

## The Present Perfect Tense

The present perfect tense expresses past action closely related to the
present.

The present perfect is a compound tense formed with the present tense
of the helping verb **haber** and the past participle of the main verb. The
English equivalent of **haber** + past participle is _to have done something._ In
the present tense, it corresponds to the present perfect in English: _I have
eaten there many times_ , for example.
The present perfect tense expresses the following:

- An action that we are waiting for, but that hasn’t yet happened
- An action that began in the past and continues to the present
- An action that has happened at various times in the past and may happen
    again

## Formation of the Past Participle

## -Ar Verbs

To form the past participle of all **-ar** verbs, drop the ending and add **-ado**
to the stem.


### -Er and -ir Verbs

To form the past participle of most **-er** and **-ir** verbs, drop the ending and
add **-ido** to the stem.

**_-Er_** **Verbs**

**_-Ir_** **Verbs**


##### Pronunciation Reminder

```
In all regular past participles, the Spanish d is pronounced like the
soft th sound in English other. Practice the pronunciation of past
participles with a th sound.
```
**-Er** and **-ir** verbs whose stem ends in a vowel have a written accent above
the **-i-** in the past participle to maintain the **-ido** sound.

Verbs that end in **-uir** do not carry a written accent in the past participle.


### Irregular Past Participles

Following are the 12 basic irregular past participles in Spanish. Pronounce
each of them as you learn them.

When a prefix is added to any of the irregular verbs above, the past
participle shows the same irregularity.

#### Exercise 23.1

_Write the past participle of the following verbs. Pronounce each past
participle aloud, and make sure you know the meaning of the verb._


### Formation of the Present Perfect Tense

To form the present perfect tense in Spanish, conjugate the helping verb
**haber** (the English auxiliary verb _to have_ ) in the present tense and follow
it with the past participle of the main verb.

NOTE The verb **haber** is used as an auxiliary or helping verb to form the
perfect tenses. The verb **tener** means _to have_ in the sense of possession: **yo
tengo dos libros**. **Tener** is never used as an auxiliary verb.

The helping verb **haber** cannot be separated from the past participle. In a
question, place the subject after the verb form.


#### Exercise 23.2

```
Complete the following phrases with the correct past participle of the verb
in parentheses. Practice pronouncing each phrase aloud.
```
1. yo he ___________________ (ser)
2. tú has ___________________ (tener)
3. ella ha ___________________ (poder)
4. nosotros hemos ___________________ (estar)
5. vosotros habéis ___________________ (querer)
6. ellas han ___________________ (saber)
7. yo he ___________________ (decir)

9. Ud. ha ___________________ (volver)
10. nosotros hemos ___________________ (poner)
11. vosotros habéis ___________________ (hacer)
12. Uds. han ___________________ (llegar)

```
Complete the following phrases with the correct form of the present
perfect tense of the verb in parentheses.
```
13. yo ___________________ (dormir)
14. tú ___________________ (romper)
15. ella ___________________ (abrir)
16. nosotros ___________________ (estar)
17. vosotros ___________________ (escribir)
18. ellas ___________________ (ver)

### Uses of the Present Perfect Tense

```
The present perfect tense expresses an action closely related to the present.
Its English equivalent corresponds to the present perfect tense in English.
The present perfect tense expresses the following:
```
- An action that we are waiting for, but that hasn’t yet happened


- An action that began in the past and continues to the present
- An action that has happened at various times in the past and may happen
    again

NOTE The words **jamás** (meaning _ever_ in an affirmative sentence or
question), **ya** (meaning _already_ ), and **todavía** (meaning _still_ or _yet_ )
frequently occur in sentences using the present perfect tense.

### Action Waited for or Hoped for

Compare the following sentences. The first sentence of each pair is in the
preterit and the second is in the present perfect.


### Action That Began in the Past and

### Continues to the Present

### Action That Happened in the Past and

### May Happen Again

Often the actions expressed can be counted.

### Placement of Object Pronouns with the

### Present Perfect Tense

The reflexive, indirect, and direct object pronouns are placed directly
before the helping verb. This is the only possible position for object


```
pronouns used with the present perfect tense. The object pronouns are
never attached to the past participle.
```
#### Exercise 23.3

```
Complete the following sentences with the correct form of the present
perfect tense of the verb in parentheses.
```
1. Laura nos ___________________ la carta. (traer)
2. Nosotros todavía no la ___________________. (recibir)
3. Los hoteleros no me ___________________. (llamar)
4. Sus hermanos nunca le ___________________ dinero. (prestar)

9. Uds. ___________________ bien el trabajo. (hacer)
10. Tus colegas siempre ___________________ bien de ti. (hablar)
11. Irene y su hermano jamás ___________________. (viajar)
12. Yo la ___________________ recientemente. (ver)
13. Yo no ___________________ dormir. (poder)


14. Ellas ya ___________________. (acostarse)
15. Nosotros ___________________ a otra casa. (mudarse)

### Use of the Infinitive haber and the Past

### Participle

```
The infinitive form of the helping verb haber is used after a preposition.
```
```
Because object pronouns can never be attached to the past participle, when
they are needed in an infinitive + past participle construction, they must be
attached to the infinitive, in this case, haber.
```
#### Exercise 23.4

```
Complete the following sentences with the correct form of haber.
```

1. Después de ___________________ leído el párrafo, los estudiantes
    están contentos.
2. Nosotros ___________________ corrido a casa.
3. Sus padres les ___________________ dado una bienvenida.

El apartamento
```
¿Desde cuándo viven los inquilinos en este edificio en la calle cuarenta y
seis con la novena avenida? ¿Quién sabe? La gente no se mete en la vida
de nadie. Pero yo sí sé porque me gusta observar la ida y vuelta de la
muchedumbre. Es verdad que hay muchos inquilinos que ya se han ido o
les han alquilado su apartamento a otros. Los apartamentos son pequeños,
pero agradables, y bastante baratos en comparación a otros lugares en la
ciudad. Por mi parte, sigo firmando el contrato de arrendamiento año de
por medio con muchísimas ganas de quedarme. Los porteros son
agradables y el superintendente, que vive solo en el primer piso, nos trata
bien.

Una pareja del octavo piso ha tenido un bebé hace ocho meses y están
viviendo felices. En el décimo piso, dos personas, una mujer que está vieja
ya, aunque tiene solamente cuarenta y cinco años, y su compañero (nunca
se han casado) se pelean, gritan, y comen mucha comida rápida de
restaurantes. (Veo a los mensajeros con pizza o con comida china todo el
tiempo). Una mujer muy simpática del tercer piso se ha muerto, y otra
mujer del cuarto piso, pelirroja, cuyo perro se ha desaparecido, vive
desesperada y triste. En el piso once, un hombre amargado sin amigos
sube y baja en el ascensor todos los días. Cuando voy vagando por el
edificio, escucho a veces sonidos de amor por la noche en el sexto y el
séptimo. En el quinto piso vive un hombre a quien le gusta patinar. Hace
muchos años, él tenía una novia bonita e inteligente. Se separaron de
repente, y este hombre, tan fuerte y guapo en días pasados, nunca ha tenido


otra compañera. Un día voy a escribir un libro, pero por ahora, estoy

## The Past Perfect Tense

The past perfect tense refers to action that occurred in the past prior to
another past action. It is a compound tense. The past perfect tense in
Spanish corresponds to the same tense in English: _I had eaten,_ for
example.

## Formation of the Past Perfect Tense

To form the past perfect tense in Spanish, conjugate the helping verb
**haber** in the imperfect, and follow it with the past participle of the main
verb.

## Uses of the Past Perfect Tense

The past perfect tense occurs in sentences and questions that are directly
linked to the past. It expresses an action that precedes another action: A
sentence may begin with the imperfect or preterit and continue with the
past perfect.


The reflexive, indirect, and direct object pronouns precede the helping
verb **haber**.

The infinitive form of the helping verb **haber** is used after a preposition.

pensaba. El martes, había pensado en el amor y eso le cogió mal, el
miércoles, había pensado en el dinero, pero tampoco le salió bien el sueño.

Recordando Nicaragua
```
En el año 1987 Nicaragua estaba sufriendo los fines de su guerra civil. Los
sandinistas luchaban contra el ejército de Somoza, los contras luchaban
contra los sandinistas. Daniel Ortega era presidente y líder de los
sandinistas, el nombre y el movimiento inspirados por Augusto César
Sandino, héroe nacional de Nicaragua que había muerto muchos años
atrás.
Era mucho que entender—quien estaba luchando contra quien y por
qué.
Fui a Managua, capital de Nicaragua, con un grupo de intérpretes y
científicos. Llegamos en agosto a una casa agradable entre gente amable.
Desde el principio, nos sentíamos cómodos en nuestra pensión; los dueños
nicaragüenses nos trataban bien, nos servían las comidas, y nos mostraban
su poesía. (Nos parecía que toda la gente era poeta.)

Después de haber estado en Managua dos días, empezamos nuestro
trabajo en la universidad, enseñándoles a los estudiantes avanzados las
matemáticas, la ciencia, la medicina, y la astrofísica.
Por la noche volvíamos a la casa y pasábamos muchas noches
agradables con amigos; hablábamos de la guerra, de las drogas, de la
felicidad. Lo increíble era que a pesar de todo, los nicaragüenses habían
mantenido un amor profundo por la vida. Mientras tanto, la guerra
continuaba.

### The Past Participle as an Adjective

```
Now that you have learned the past participle, your vocabulary will expand
even more, because the past participle is also used as an adjective. As an
adjective, the past participle follows the noun it describes, and it agrees
with its noun in gender and number.
```
#### Exercise 24.4

```
Complete the following phrases with the past participle of the verb in
parentheses used as an adjective. Remember that the adjective agrees in
gender and number with its noun. Practice pronouncing the phrases aloud.
```

2. la mesa ___________________ (romper)
3. el pájaro ___________________ (morir)
4. la tarea bien ___________________ (hacer)
5. las ideas bien ___________________ (expresar)
6. el niño ___________________ (dormir)
7. el amigo ___________________ (querer)
8. los carros ___________________ (vender)

12. el apartamento ___________________ (alquilar)
13. el tesoro ___________________ (esconder)
14. las cartas ___________________ (entregar)
15. la telenovela ___________________ (grabar)

### The Past Participle as an Adjective with

### estar

```
The past participle as an adjective is usually used with estar.
```
```
When the past participle is used as an adjective with estar , it indicates that
the idea expressed is the result of an action.
```
```
Susana va a escribir un libro. > Ella está escribiendo un libro. > El libro
está escrito.
```

NOTE Whether you are aware of this concept or not, you can still use **estar**
+ past participle with confidence when you are describing someone or
something.

#### Exercise 24.5

_Complete the following sentences with the correct form of_ **estar** _+ past
participle as an adjective._

### The Past Participle with ser and the

### Passive Voice

The past participle is also used with **ser**. When used with **ser** , the past
participle expresses the action itself, in this case, the passive voice, rather
than the result of an action. The passive voice consists of **ser** + past
participle and is often followed by **por**. The past participle agrees in
gender and number with the subject of the sentence.

- In the preterit


- In the present perfect and past perfect

In speech, it is generally much better to use the active voice. The passive
voice is used infrequently in Spanish. For example, the passive voice is
used in this sentence:

However, it is better to use the active voice you already know.

#### Exercise 24.7

_Rewrite the following passive sentences as sentences in the active voice._

El conde Lucanor

_Don Juan Manuel nació en Escalona, Toledo, y se murió en 1348 en
Peñafiel, Valladolid. Él pertenece a la tradición literaria-didáctica de la
Edad Media._


Había en la corte de Castilla un hombre de gran inteligencia y virtud
llamado don Sancho, el cual era muy estimado por el rey. Una de las
expresiones favoritas de don Sancho era la siguiente: “Todo lo que nos
pasa es siempre para lo mejor.”

Algunos nobles le tenían envidia y lo acusaron de que preparaba una
revolución. El rey les creyó y envió un mensajero para que don Sancho
viniera inmediatamente a la corte. Al mismo tiempo, el rey daba órdenes
para matarlo en camino.

Don Sancho se apresuró a obedecer, pero al bajar de prisa las escaleras
de su casa, se cayó y se rompió una pierna. En medio del dolor, repetía:
“Todo lo que nos pasa es siempre para lo mejor.”

A causa del accidente, no pudo ir a la corte del rey. Mientras tanto, éste
descubrió la falsedad de las acusaciones contra don Sancho y castigó a los
culpables. Don Sancho se dirigió, por fin, a la corte, donde fue recibido
con grandes honores.

# Future and Conditional Tenses;

# Past Subjunctive; Idioms


# 25

## The Future Tense

The future tense is used to express actions that take place in the future. It
refers to both the immediate and the remote future. This is a simple tense,
in that it has no helping verb in Spanish. In English, the auxiliaries _will_ or
_shall_ are used: _Irene will drink the water_ , for example.

## Formation of the Future Tense

Most verbs in the future tense are regular. To form the future tense, use the
infinitive as the stem and add the following endings to the infinitive: **-é,
-ás, -á, -emos, -éis, -án**. The endings are the same for all **-ar, -er** , and **-ir**
verbs. Notice that only the **nosotros** form does not carry a written accent.
The following list includes new verbs so that you can expand your
vocabulary as you practice the pronunciation.

## Regular Verbs

## -Ar Verbs



##### A Word About Pronunciation

```
When a word carries a written accent, you will stress that syllable:
Make sure you pronounce the verbs in this way: yo cantaré, tú
cantarás, él cantará, nosotros cantaremos, vosotros cantaréis,
ellos cantarán. Practice pronouncing these verb forms aloud with
confidence.
```
**_-Er_** **Verbs**



**_-Ir_** **Verbs**




##### A Word About -ir Verbs with a Written Accent in the

##### Infinitive

```
-Ir verbs that have a written accent in the infinitive, such as oír ( to
hear ), reír ( to laugh ), and sonreír ( to smile ), lose the written accent
in the stem in order to form the future: oiré, reiré, sonreiré.
```
### Irregular Verbs

There are only 12 basic irregular verbs in the future tense. These verbs
show a change in the stem, but the endings are the same as those you have
just learned. Add **-é, -ás, -á, -emos, -éis, -án** to the irregular stem. Practice
saying these verb forms aloud, and learn them so that you will be able to
use the future tense freely.



##### Reminder

**Valer** is most frequently used in the third person.


##### A Word About haber

```
Habrá means there will be and will there be? It is the future tense of
the verb haber.
```
Compound forms of verbs are conjugated in the same way as the main
verb.


### Uses of the Future Tense

The future tense is used in both Spanish and English to express a future
time. The simple future transmits more of a commitment or a strong
decision than does the future periphrastic ( **ir** + **a** + _infinitive_ ). The
difference also exists in English: _I will arrive at 7 P.M._ is a little stronger in
terms of commitment than _I am going to arrive at 7 P.M._

### Expressing Doubt or Probability in the

### Present

```
The equivalent in English can be I wonder or it is probably to indicate
doubt or probability. You will know from context whether the sentence or
question expresses the simple future or probability in the present.
```

### Expressing the Future Using the Present

### Tense

- The present indicative is often used when there is another element in
    the sentence that indicates future time.
- The present tense, not the future, is used when asking for instructions.
- The present tense, not the future, is used when you’re asking for things.
    These are not actions that take place in the future; in these cases, _will_ is
    a helping verb expressing a voluntary mood.


#### Exercise 25.6

_Rewrite the following sentences to indicate probability._

EXAMPLE El libro no cabe en mi bolsa.
El libro no cabrá en mi bolsa.

1. ¿Tiene hambre el niño? ___________________

### Placement of Reflexive, Indirect, and

### Direct Object Pronouns

Review object pronouns as you continue adding to your knowledge of
tenses. The reflexive, indirect, and direct object pronouns have two
possible positions when used with the future tense.

- Object pronouns can be placed directly before the conjugated verb.
- Object pronouns can be attached to an infinitive if one is used in the
    phrase or sentence.

### The Future Progressive Tense


The future progressive tense emphasizes action that will be in progress in
the future. When you don’t need to express action that will be in progress
in the future, use the simple future tense.

### Formation of the Future Progressive Tense

The future progressive is a compound tense. To form this tense, conjugate
**estar** in the future and follow it with the gerund of the main verb.

### Uses of the Future Progressive Tense

The future progressive tense emphasizes action that will take place in the
future: _I will be arriving by 10 o’clock,_ for example. If you don’t need to
emphasize the action, use the simple future: _I will arrive by 10 o’clock._


### The Future Perfect Tense

In Spanish, as in English, the future perfect tense refers to an action that
will be completed in the future before another action occurs or before
some point of time in the future.

### Formation of the Future Perfect Tense

The future perfect is a compound tense. To form this tense, conjugate
**haber** in the future and follow it with the past participle of the main verb.

### Uses of the Future Perfect Tense

The future perfect tense expresses action that will have taken place by a
specific time in the future.

## The Conditional Tense

The conditional tense is used to describe actions that are uncertain in the
future. Unlike the future tense, which expresses future certainty, the
conditional expresses an action that would happen if another condition
were met. This is a simple tense, in that it uses no helping verb in Spanish.
It corresponds to the conditional tense in English, which uses _would_ as an
auxiliary verb: _I would go, but I don’t have time,_ for example.

## Formation of the Conditional Tense

Most verbs are regular in the conditional tense. To form the conditional,
use the infinitive as the stem and add the following endings to the
infinitive: **-ía, -ías, -ía, -íamos, -íais, -ían**. These endings are used for all
verbs, both regular and irregular, in the conditional tense. Practice
pronouncing the following conditional verb forms aloud and be sure to
stress the accented syllable.

##### Pronunciation Reminder

```
Practice pronouncing the d with a soft th sound.
```
## Regular Verbs


#### -Ar Verbs


##### Pronunciation Reminder

```
The r at the beginning of a breath group is pronounced as an rr trill.
Practice pronouncing these forms of recordar with the trilled r.
```
**_-Er_** **Verbs**



**_-Ir_** **Verbs**

##### Pronunciation Reminder

```
The g before an i is pronounced like the English h as in hot.
```

### Irregular Verbs

There are 12 basic irregular verbs in the conditional tense. The conditional
and future tenses have the same stems in their irregular verbs. Add **-ía,
-ías, -ía, -íamos, -íais, -ían** to the irregular stem. Practice pronouncing
these verb forms aloud, and learn them so that you will be able to use the
conditional tense freely.



##### Reminder

As noted, **valer** is most often used in the third person:

##### A Word About haber

**Habría** means _there would be_ and _would there be?_ It is the
conditional tense of the verb **haber**.


Compound forms of verbs are conjugated in the same way as the main
verb.

### Uses of the Conditional Tense

The conditional tense expresses action that is uncertain in the future. This
tense corresponds to the English conditional tense: _I would go,_ for
example.


##### A Word About English would

```
In English, the translation of the Spanish imperfect tense sometimes
uses the word would as a helping verb when expressing repeated
action in the past. Following are examples of the imperfect tense:
```

### Placement of Reflexive, Indirect, and

### Direct Object Pronouns

```
The reflexive, indirect, and direct object pronouns have two possible

```
The conditional tense may be used to express speculation or conjecture in
the past. The translation _I wonder or It was probably_ indicates doubt or
conjecture. You will know from context whether the sentence or question
expresses the simple conditional or probability in the past.

### The Conditional Progressive Tense

The conditional progressive tense expresses doubt about action in the
future.

### Formation of the Conditional Progressive

### Tense


The conditional progressive is a compound tense. To form this tense,
conjugate **estar** in the conditional and follow it with the gerund of the
main verb.

### Uses of the Conditional Progressive Tense

The conditional progressive tense expresses doubt in the future and
emphasizes the action. When you don’t need to emphasize the action, use
the simple conditional. You’ll find that the simple conditional is used
more frequently in everyday speech.

### The Conditional Perfect Tense

The conditional perfect tense is used to express an action that would have
taken place, but did not: _I would have paid you, but I left my money at
home,_ for example.

### Formation of the Conditional Perfect

### Tense


The conditional perfect is a compound tense. To form this tense, conjugate
the helping verb **haber** in the conditional tense and follow it with the past
participle of the main verb.

### Uses of the Conditional Perfect Tense

The conditional perfect tense, which is used to refer to an action that
would have occurred but did not, is often followed by English _but._

Remember that reflexive, indirect, and direct object pronouns precede the
verb form. The object pronouns are never attached to the past participle.


The conditional perfect tense may also express speculation or conjecture
in the past.

## The Present Perfect Subjunctive

The present perfect subjunctive mood refers to the recent past and is
translated as the present perfect in English: _the train has arrived,_ for
example.
Like all subjunctive moods, the present perfect subjunctive must be
caused. The main clause must have a verb or expression that calls for the
use of the subjunctive mood in the dependent clause. The present or future
tense of certain verbs in the main clause will cause the present perfect
subjunctive in the dependent clause.

## Formation of the Present Perfect

## Subjunctive

The present perfect subjunctive is a compound verb form. To form the
present perfect subjunctive, conjugate the present subjunctive of the
helping verb **haber** and follow it with the past participle of the main verb.


### Uses of the Present Perfect Subjunctive

The present perfect subjunctive can be used to express a past action if the
main clause is in the present or future tense. The main clause must contain
a verb or expression that causes the subjunctive in the dependent clause.
The most common use is the present indicative in the main clause and the
present perfect subjunctive in the dependent clause.

NOTE The English translation of the dependent clause is the same, whether
the Spanish verb is in the indicative or the subjunctive mood.

- Main clause in the present, dependent clause in present perfect
    subjunctive

- Main clause in the future, dependent clause in the present perfect
subjunctive
If the verb in the main clause is either the future periphrastic ( **ir** + **a** +
_infinitive_ ) or the simple future, the present perfect subjunctive can be
used in the dependent clause. This structure is used infrequently in
everyday speech.

```
La isla en el Caribe
```
```
Me alegro mucho de que mis amigos se hayan puesto tan contentos antes
de mi gran viaje a verlos. Se llaman Samuel y Teresa y viven en una isla
que se llama Saba.
Nos encontramos por primera vez en el Yucatán donde viajamos juntos.
Según ellos, Saba es el mejor sitio del mundo. Estoy muy emocionada
de que ellos me hayan invitado a su hogar tan especial. Ella es francesa y
él es de Inglaterra. Han pasado más de veinte años fuera de sus países. No
sé por qué han escogido esta isla en el medio del Caribe. Nunca me han
dado la razón y nadie sabe el porqué, excepto ellos.
Estoy contenta de que hayamos podido estar en contacto por tanto
tiempo, comunicándonos por correo electrónico.
```

Arreglo mi maleta, pensando en lo que mis amigos me han dicho. Con
cuidado, meto en ella bloqueador, anteojos de sol y camisas de algodón.
Me dicen que llueve mucho, así que incluyo un paraguas pequeño y un
impermeable. En caso de que haya sol, y esperándolo, traigo dos trajes de
baño, una bata, sandalias y gafas para nadar. A ellos les gusta bucear, y a
mí también. Dejo en casa mi abrigo, y escojo una chaqueta y un chaleco
que compré en Guatemala. Me gusta llevar pantalones, pero voy a traer
una falda también. No sé si necesitaré calcetines o botas, pero los traeré de
todos modos.

Será mi primer viaje a la isla y mis amigos la describen como un
paraíso, pero un paraíso sin muchas provisiones. Me piden que les lleve
muchos víveres como nueces, queso, cereal y chocolate. Mi pobre maleta,
cambiada a maletón, pesa mucho con toda la comida, pero llevaré todo, y
con muchas ganas.
Me recogieron en el aeropuerto y fuimos a Saba a su hogar. Ellos se
sentaron en el sofá. Samuel empezó a trabajar en la computadora; ella no
hizo nada aquella primera noche.

Esta pareja que siempre hablaba, dejó de hablar.
Dormí bastante bien la primera noche a pesar de los insectos, reyes de
la casa que andaban por toda la casa, y el sonido de la ranas más allá de mi
ventana.

Samuel y Teresa, mis queridos amigos, no sé lo que les había pasado.
Pasé mis vacaciones a solas. Ellos no se atrevían a salir de la casa, hasta
sacar la basura. Samuel llegaba al lindero de la casa, suspiraba y volvía a
la sala mientras Teresa cocinaba.

Por fin, me llevaron al aeropuerto, me dejaron allí, nos despedimos y
nos separamos. Fue la última vez que los vi.

## The Imperfect Subjunctive

The imperfect subjunctive mood expresses past action. So far, you have
studied the present subjunctive and the present perfect subjunctive. Next is
the imperfect subjunctive. If the main clause begins in the past, it can
cause the subjunctive in the past.

Remember that the subjunctive mood cannot exist alone. Another
element in the sentence always causes it to be used. The imperfect
subjunctive is used after the following elements:

- Certain impersonal expressions
- Certain verbs
- Certain conjunctions
- Certain dependent adjective clauses
- Certain expressions

## Formation of the Imperfect Subjunctive

To form the imperfect subjunctive for all verbs, first drop the ending of the
third-person singular of the preterit. What remains is the stem of the
imperfect subjunctive for all forms.
Any irregularity in the stem of the preterit tense will have the same
irregularity in the imperfect subjunctive.

## Imperfect Subjunctive of -ar Verbs


To conjugate all but three **-ar** verbs in the imperfect subjunctive, begin
with the third-person singular ( **él, ella, Ud.** ) of the preterit tense. Drop the
preterit ending and add **-ara, -aras, -ara, -áramos, -arais, -aran** to the
stem.

The only **-ar** verbs with different endings in the imperfect subjunctive are
verbs that are irregular in the preterit: **andar, estar, dar**.

### Imperfect Subjunctive of -er and -ir Verbs

To conjugate both **-er** and **-ir** verbs in the imperfect subjunctive, drop the
ending from the third-person singular of the preterit to get the stem. Then
add **-iera, -ieras, -iera, -iéramos, -ierais, -ieran** to the stem.

**_-Er_** **Verbs**



**-Ir** verbs that are irregular in the third-person singular of the preterit show
the same irregularity in the stem of the imperfect subjunctive.


##### A Word About Pronunciation

```
The stress in the imperfect subjunctive is on the second-to-last, or
penultimate, syllable. As you practice, make sure you pronounce the
verbs in this way: yo cantara, tú cantaras, él cantara, nosotros
cantáramos, vosotros cantarais, ellos cantaran. If a word carries a
written accent, stress the accented syllable: nosotros cantáramos.
The more you practice, the more natural this sound becomes.
```
### Irregular Stems in the Preterit

Verbs with irregular stems in the preterit have the same irregularity in the
imperfect subjunctive. Drop the ending from the third-person singular and
add **-iera, -ieras, -iera, -iéramos, -ierais, -ieran** to the stem.



Irregular preterits whose stem ends in **-j** have **-eran** , not **-ieran** , in the
third-person plural. Take a look at **decir, producir** , and **traer**.


The conjugations for **ir** and **ser** are identical in the imperfect subjunctive.
The meaning will be clarified in context.

##### A Word About haber

```
Hubiera is the imperfect subjunctive form of haber , formed from the
third-person singular of the preterit, hubo , meaning there was, there
were.
```
Compound forms of verbs are conjugated in the same way as the main
verb.


### Uses of the Imperfect Subjunctive

When the main clause contains a verb or expression that causes the
subjunctive in a dependent clause, the presence of an element in the main
clause that begins in the past makes it mandatory to use the imperfect
subjunctive in the dependent clause. You do not have to make any
decisions, nor do you have a choice about whether or not to use it. The


conditional can also cause the imperfect subjunctive in the dependent
clause.

### After Certain Impersonal Expressions

Certain impersonal expressions in the main clause will cause the
subjunctive in the dependent clause.

If the impersonal expressions are in the preterit, the imperfect, or the
conditional tense, they will cause the imperfect subjunctive in the
dependent clause. Note the differences in the English translations for the
dependent clauses below, depending on what is expressed by the verb in
the main clause.


#### Exercise 28.1

_Complete the following sentences with the correct imperfect subjunctive
form of the verb in parentheses, then translate the sentence._

EXAMPLES Fue fantástico que nosotros tuviéramos éxito. (tener)
_It was fantastic that we were successful._

```

It was impossible that Octavio slept well last night.
```

```

```
1. Fue importante que Jaime me ___________________. (hablar)
2. Era una lástima que ella no ___________________ bien anoche.

9. Sería bueno que Uds. ___________________. (mejorarse)
10. Era probable que toda la clase ___________________. (graduarse)

13. Sería necesario que los turistas ___________________ mucha agua
en las montañas. (tomar)
14. Sería dudoso que nosotros ___________________ a México este año.
(viajar)
15. Fue posible que Beatriz e Isabel ___________________ en Italia.
(quedarse)

### After Certain Verbs

```
Review the verbs that cause the subjunctive mood in a dependent clause,
namely, verbs that express wishes and preferences; verbs that express
hope, regret and emotion; verbs that express orders; and verbs that express
```

uncertainty. These verbs in the main clause will cause the subjunctive
mood in the dependent clause. If the main clause is in the preterit, the
imperfect, or the conditional, the dependent clause will be in the imperfect
subjunctive.

##### A Word About the English Translations


```
You can see that English translations of the imperfect subjunctive are
not exact. Just remember that if you start out in either the past
(preterit or imperfect) or the conditional in the main clause, the verb
or impersonal expression will cause the imperfect subjunctive in the
dependent clause.

El barco económico
```

Lucía siempre tenía ganas de ir a las Islas Galápagos y quería que su buen
amigo la acompañara, pero no quiso. Después de haberlo pensado bien,
decidió ir sola, primero a Quito, capital de Ecuador. Ella conoció a mucha
gente en la ciudad, exploró los vecindarios durante el día; por la noche
volvía a su hotel que le costaba cinco dólares. Ella comía el desayuno en
una cafetería, el almuerzo en otra, y cenaba en un buen restaurante en el
centro. Esperaba que alguien pasara por allí, que la viera sentada, que
entrara en el restaurante, y que hablara con ella. Esperaba que los dos se
llevaran bien y que él quisiera ir con ella a la isla.
Al fin y al cabo, Lucía viajó a Guayaquil, la entrada de las islas, y la
salida de los barcos y cruceros. En la agencia de viajes, le sugirieron que
fuera en barco económico con un grupo pequeño de aventureros. “Costaría
menos,” dijo la agente, “y sería más divertido el viaje.” La agente la
convenció.

La mujer tomó la decisión, compró su pasaje de ida y vuelta para el
próximo día, y después de una noche inquieta e indecisa, abordó el barco
chiquito. Aquella primera noche, el barco salió, y entre las olas, la
tormenta, y el huracán, los ocho pasajeros pasaron la noche mareados bajo
las estrellas centelleantes del cielo.

### After Certain Conjunctions

The subjunctive form follows certain conjunctions if the main clause has a
different subject from the dependent clause.

### After Certain Dependent Adjective

### Clauses


The subjunctive mood is used in a dependent clause if the object or person
described in the main clause of a sentence is indefinite or nonexistent. In
the following examples, the objects and persons described in the main
clause are not known.

### After Certain Expressions

- **ojalá**

```
An interjection of Arabic origin, ojalá means would to God that or may
God grant that and expresses great desire. It can also be translated as I
hope.
```
- **como si**

```
A verb that follows como si ( as if ) will be in the imperfect subjunctive.
The verb in the main clause can be in the present, the past, or the
conditional.
```

- **quisiera**

```
The verb querer can be used in the imperfect subjunctive in a main
clause, where it is used to soften statements and questions. This form
changes the translation of I want, for example, to I would like.
```
```
Compare the meanings of the following pairs of sentences:
```
- **pudiera**

```
The imperfect subjunctive form of poder can be used independently in a
main clause. It is used to soften statements, for example, puedo ( I can, I
am able ) to yo pudiera ( I could, I would be able ).
```

### After si in a Contrary-to-Fact si -clause

```
When you express the idea that an action would happen (conditional tense)
if another action occurred in the past, the imperfect subjunctive is used in
the clause that begins with si.
```

##### A Word About the si -clause in the Present

```
A si -clause used with a present tense verb never causes the
subjunctive. When you express the idea that an action will happen
(future tense) if another action occurs in the present, the imperfect
subjunctive is not used.
```
In the following examples, a clause whose verb is in the conditional tense
begins the sentence. Note that the imperfect subjunctive follows the word
**si**. It doesn’t matter whether the sentence begins with the conditional tense
or the **si** _-_ clause, the subjunctive always follows **si**.


#### Exercise 28.11

```
Complete the following sentences with the correct form of the verbs in
parentheses. Each sentence requires both the conditional and the
imperfect subjunctive verb forms. Remember that the imperfect subjunctive
follows the si -clause.
```
```
EXAMPLES ¿Qué haría Ud. si sus amigos le dijeran una mentira?
(hacer/decir)
```
```
Si no hubiera tráfico, podríamos salir más tarde.
(haber/poder)
```
1. Si Fernando ___________________ más alto, ___________________
    deportista. (ser/ser)
2. Si a María le ___________________ bailar, ___________________ a
    fiestas. (gustar/ir)
3. Si nosotros le ___________________ cartas, nuestro amigo nos
    ___________________. (escribir/responder)
4. Si yo ___________________ mejor, yo ___________________
    reírme. (sentirse/poder)
5. Los artistas ___________________ más dinero, si
    ___________________ sus pinturas. (ganar/vender)
6. Los médicos dicen que los insomnes ___________________ mejor si
    ___________________ a la misma hora cada noche.
    (dormir/acostarse).
7. Nosotros ___________________ con soltura si
    ___________________ todos los verbos. (hablar/saber)
8. La muchacha no ___________________ frío si
    ___________________ la chaqueta. (tener/ponerse)
9. El niño no ___________________ tanto si no le
    ___________________ el estómago. (llorar/doler)
10. Yo no ___________________ si Ud. ___________________ que yo
___________________. (irse/querer/quedarse)


If the sentence or question includes the word **si** in a sentence that is not
contrary-to-fact, but rather is simply a statement, the subjunctive is not
used.

Xochicalco
(The place of the flowers)
```
Si Leonora pudiera viajar al pasado, ella viajaría al décimo siglo para
averiguar por qué casi todos los centros de los mayas se habían
desaparecido acerca del año 900 A.D. Nadie sabe la causa, según ella.
Pienso que ella habría sido una buena arqueóloga por su curiosidad, pero
me dijo que jamás le gustaba la idea de excavar la tierra, ni con máquinas,
ni con las manos. Prefiere andar por las ruinas, sintiendo como era la vida
en la edad de los mayas.
¿Has oído de Xochicalco, cerca de Cuernavaca, México? Supongo que
no. Es poco conocido, pero magnífico, dice ella. La estructura principal se
llama ‘la serpiente emplumada’ y ella se quedaba horas mirándola,
tratando de entender lo que significa el arte del templo.

Me contó que quería subir la pirámide de Quetzalcóatl, pero no pudo.
Un guía la vio intentar y la mostró como se hace. En vez de ascender recto,
como hace casi toda la gente, él le dijo que subiera y bajara zigzagueando.
De esta manera, escaló rápida y fácilmente.
¿Has oído de Ceibal en Guatemala? Por fin, Leonora fue con otro
fanático de los mayas y estaba muy feliz con su compañero. Viajaron por
barco por el Río Pasión. Me habría gustado acompañarla también, pero
ella no pensaba en mí. De todos modos, ella y su amigo se enteraron que


Ceibal, poblado en 900 B.C. y abandonado en 900 A.D., habría podido ser el
centro de la civilización maya. En un sitio bien escondido, vieron estatuas
de hombres negros y otras que parecían ser judíos. Estoy seguro que se
divirtieron mucho.

Leonora quería que yo te recomendara otros sitios fantásticos para
explorar. En el Yucatán, sería una maravilla que visitaras las ruinas de
Tulum en la costa de México, o Chitzén Itzá entre Cancún y Mérida,
Uxmal donde se ve estatuas de Chac, el dios de la lluvia, o Tikal, en
Guatemala, una de las más grandes de todas. Y si vas, no te olvides de mí

## The Past Perfect Subjunctive

The past perfect subjunctive, also called the pluperfect subjunctive, is
often translated the same as the indicative past perfect tense in English,
for example, _I had eaten_. Like all subjunctives, this form must be caused
by a verb or expression that causes the use of the subjunctive mood in the
dependent clause.

## Formation of the Past Perfect Subjunctive

The past perfect subjunctive is a compound verb form. To form the past
perfect subjunctive, use the imperfect subjunctive of the helping verb
**haber** and follow it with the past participle of the main verb.

## Uses of the Past Perfect Subjunctive

The past perfect subjunctive expresses action that happened before another
action occurred. As you know, the subjunctive mood cannot exist alone.


An element in the main clause causes the subjunctive in the dependent
clause.

### After Certain Verbs

Certain verbs cause the subjunctive in a dependent clause. If the verb in
the main clause is in the past (imperfect or preterit), these verbs can cause
the past perfect subjunctive in the dependent clause.

### After Certain Impersonal Expressions

Certain impersonal expressions in the main clause cause the subjunctive in
a dependent clause. If these expressions are in the past, they can cause the
past perfect subjunctive in the dependent clause.


- After **ojalá**

```
The past perfect subjunctive is used to express a contrary-to-fact wish in
the past with ojalá.
```
- **quisiera**

```
The use of the imperfect subjunctive of querer , most often quisiera , in
the main clause can cause the past perfect subjunctive in the dependent
clause.
```
#### Exercise 29.1

_Complete the following sentences with the correct past perfect subjunctive
form of the verb in parentheses. In these sentences, the main clause is in_


```
the imperfect or preterit. Note the element that causes the use of this
mood.
```
```
EXAMPLE Era importante que nosotros hubiéramos recibido el cheque.
(recibir)
```
1. Jorge no estaba seguro que nosotros ___________________ la cuenta.
    (pagar)
2. Ella esperaba que nosotros ___________________ una cita con su

### The Contrary-to-Fact Conditional si-

### clause in the Past

```
When you express the idea that an action would have happened
(conditional perfect tense) if another action had occurred in the past, the
past perfect subjunctive follows the clause that begins with si.
Review the conditional perfect tense:
```

The **si** -clause expresses the idea that something would have happened if
something else had happened. Remember that the subjunctive form
follows **si**.

##### A Word About the si -clause

```
In everyday speech, the perfect conditional (for example, habría
hecho ) is sometimes replaced by the past perfect subjunctive
( hubiera hecho ). In these sentences, when a si -clause is present, both
clauses will contain the same tense—the past perfect subjunctive.
```
Compare the following sentences to the ones you have just studied. Note
that the English translations are the same. Both forms are correct.


#### Exercise 29.3

_Review the conditional perfect tense, then translate the following
sentences into Spanish. Remember that object pronouns are placed

Su punto de vista
```
```
Lo confieso: no pienso mucho en la comida. Si yo hubiera sido mejor
cocinera, si hubiera tenido el talento para combinar ingredientes, tal vez
yo hubiera podido disfrutar más las celebraciones de glotonería.
Era un día nublado de noviembre. Lo recuerdo bien. Yo vivía con cuatro
mujeres en un apartamento grande y alegre, de colores exuberantes. Cada
noviembre hacíamos planes para el día de acción de gracias. Mi
compañera de cuarto cocinaba un pavo de dieciocho libras y se despertaba
```

durante la noche para lardearlo. Otra amiga horneaba un pastel de
calabaza. Un amigo que vivía cerca traía verduras, frutas y queso. Para la
gente a quien no le gustaba el pavo, cocinábamos jamón, chuletas,
pescado, pollo asado y pato. Invitábamos a todos nuestros amigos. A las
cinco de la tarde, empezábamos nuestra cena con la bebida tradicional—el
ponche de huevo. Aquella noche, dejé mi plato de cebollas y judías verdes
y me fui.

Huí a un restaurante y cené sola, pero no me importó. Por lo menos, no
me tocó comer pavo. Hubo muchas tentaciones como mejillones en vino
blanco, camarones y langosta en salsa verde y calamares fritos. Ofrecieron
una ensalada con manzanas, nueces y pasas, aceitunas y tomates. Para el
plato fuerte, ordené la paella para dos porque lleva mariscos, guisantes y
chorizo. Después de descansar un rato, comí el flan de España y el helado
de fresas. Bebí agua mineral; no tomé ni vino, ni cerveza, ni champaña, ni
licor y no me emborraché. Volví a casa; mis amigos estuvieron contentos
de verme, les había gustado mi plato de verduras y todos se acostaron
agradecidos.

### Time Expressions

#### Present

```
The idea of how long someone has been doing something can be expressed
by three different Spanish constructions, all using the simple present
tense. The English translation is expressed best by the present perfect
tense. The action begins in the past and continues into the present.
All three constructions below, shown with their literal translations,
express the following question in the present:
```
```
How long has your professor been writing her book?
```
```
The same three constructions, shown with their literal translations, express
the following statement in the present:
```
```
She has been writing her book for four years.
```

### Past

To express how long someone had been doing something, Spanish uses the
imperfect tense. The English translation of this construction is expressed
best by the past perfect tense. The action was continuing in the past when
something else happened.
The constructions below, shown with their literal translations, express
the following question in the past:

```
How long had Lorena been waiting for the bus when it arrived?
```
The constructions below, shown with their literal translations, express the
following statement in the past:

```
She had been waiting for 30 minutes when the bus arrived.
```

El fin del juego
```
Queridos lectores,

Espero que a Uds. les haya gustado el libro. Ha sido un buen viaje y me
alegro de que Uds. hayan llegado hasta el fin. Les dejo con una parte
interesante de la historia de Sócrates en la cual él explica por qué no le va
a molestar el fin de su vida.
Ahora, me despido de Uds. y les deseo todo lo mejor.

Hasta el próximo,

La autora

```
La defensa de Sócrates
escrito por Platón
```
_La asamblea vota por la inocencia o la culpabilidad de Sócrates.
Lo condena a la pena de muerte. Lo siguiente es la respuesta de Sócrates
ante la asamblea, antes de que se lo lleve a la cárcel._

SÓCRATES La gente dirá que Uds. condenan a muerte a Sócrates, un
hombre sabio. Dirán que soy sabio si lo soy o no. Si Uds. hubieran
esperado por un rato, sus deseos hubieran sido realizados en el camino de
la naturaleza. Pueden ver que soy un hombre viejo.
Me gustaría discutir con Uds., los cuales me han absuelto, lo que ha
pasado. Concédanme, les suplico, un momento de atención, porque nada
impide que conversemos juntos, puesto que queda tiempo. Quiero decirles,
como amigos, lo que acaba de sucederme, y explicarles lo que significa.
Sí, jueces míos, me ha sucedido hoy una cosa maravillosa.

Nos engañamos todos sin duda si creemos que la muerte es un mal. Una
prueba evidente de ello es que si yo hubiera de realizar hoy algún bien, el
dios* no hubiera dejado de advertírmelo como acostumbra.
La muerte es un tránsito del alma de un lugar a otro. ¿Qué mayor
ventaja puede presentar la muerte? Si la muerte es una cosa semejante, la
llamo con razón un bien; porque entonces el tiempo todo entero, no es más
que una larga noche.

Pero si la muerte es un tránsito de un lugar a otro, y si, según se dice,
allá en un lugar está el paradero de todos los que han vivido, ¿qué mayor
bien se puede imaginar, jueces míos? ¿Qué transporte de alegría no tendría


yo cuando me encontrara con los héroes de la antigüedad, que han sido las
víctimas de la injusticia? ¿Qué placer el poder comparar mis aventuras
con las suyas? Pero aún sería un placer más grande para mí pasar allí los
días, interrogando y examinando a todos estos personajes, para distinguir
los que son verdaderamente sabios de los que creen serlo y no lo son. ¿Hay
alguno, jueces míos, que no diera todo lo que tiene en el mundo por
examinar al que condujo un ejército contra Troya, u Odiseo o Sísifo, y
tantos otros, hombres y mujeres, cuya conversación y examen serían una
felicidad inexplicable?
Ésta es la razón, jueces míos, para que nunca pierdan las esperanzas aún
después de la tumba, fundadas en esta verdad: que no hay ningún mal para
el hombre de bien, ni durante la vida, ni después de su muerte; y que los
dioses tienen siempre cuidado de cuanto tiene relación con él; porque lo
que en este momento me sucede a mí no es obra de azar, y estoy
convencido de que el mejor partido para mí es morir ahora y liberarme de
todos los disgustos de esta vida.

La hora de partir ha llegado, y nos vamos cada cual por su camino—
yo, a morir, y Uds. a vivir. Solo dios sabe cual es mejor.
