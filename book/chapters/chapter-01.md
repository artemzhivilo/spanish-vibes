## The Gender of Nouns and the Definite

## Article

A noun is a person, place, or thing.
In Spanish, all nouns are either _masculine_ or _feminine_.
In Spanish, the definite article (English _the_ ) agrees with the noun in
gender (masculine or feminine) and number (singular or plural): **el, la, los,
las**.

## Singular Nouns

##### Masculine

The masculine singular noun takes the definite article **el**.

Most nouns that end in **-o** are masculine. Pronounce the following
words aloud.


Many masculine nouns do not end in **-o** ; therefore, it is necessary to learn
each noun with its article.

Some masculine nouns end in **-a** or **-ma**.

#### Feminine

The feminine singular noun takes the definite article **la**.

Most nouns that end in **-a** are feminine. Pronounce the following words
aloud.

Nouns that end in **-ción, -sión, -dad, -tad** , or **-tud** are feminine.


A few nouns that end in **-o** are feminine.

Many feminine nouns do not follow these patterns; therefore, it is
important to learn each noun with its article.

#### Exercise 1.1

_Write the appropriate masculine or feminine form of the definite article for
each of the following nouns. As you write the answer, make sure you know
the meaning of the word_.


A noun ending in **-ista** can be masculine or feminine, depending on
whether it refers to a male or a female. The article indicates the gender of
the noun.

A noun ending in **-nte** can be masculine or feminine, depending on
whether it refers to a male or a female. The article indicates the gender of
the noun.


#### Plural Nouns

##### Masculine

A masculine noun that ends in a vowel adds **-s** to form the plural; it takes
the definite article **los**.

If the noun ends in a consonant, **el** changes to **los** and the noun adds **-es**.


#### Feminine

A feminine noun that ends in a vowel adds **-s** to form the plural; it takes
the definite article **las**.

If the noun ends in a consonant, **la** changes to **las** and the noun adds **-es**.

#### Exercise 1.2

_Write the plural form of each of the following singular nouns_.


### The Indefinite Article

The Spanish singular indefinite article (English _a, an_ ) is **un** before a
masculine noun and **una** before a feminine noun. Pronounce the words in
the following lists aloud. By learning these nouns, you are building your
vocabulary.

#### Singular Indefinite Articles


#### Plural Indefinite Articles

The Spanish plural indefinite article (English _some_ ) is **unos** before a
masculine plural noun and **unas** before a feminine plural noun.

#### Exercise 1.3


_Translate the following nouns into English. Remember to practice
pronouncing the words_.


### Adjectives

An adjective is a word that describes a noun.

A Spanish adjective agrees in gender and number with the noun it
modifies. In Spanish, an adjective almost always follows the noun it
describes.

#### Singular Form of Adjectives


Adjectives that end in **-o** are _masculine_ in form and agree with a masculine
noun. As you pronounce the following examples aloud, note that the
_adjective follows the noun_ it describes.

Adjectives that end in **-o** change the **-o** to **-a** when describing a feminine
noun.

Adjectives that do not end in **-o** have the same form for describing both
masculine and feminine nouns. It doesn’t matter what letter ends the
adjective, as long as it is not **_-_** **o**.
